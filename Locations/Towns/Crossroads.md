## Notable Locations
#### Town Hold
Location - On top of a small bluff on the east side of the town
The seat of government for the region. The grounds include stables, a mage tower, and an armour. It is well protected by fort walls and the town garrison.

A fancy inn frequented by merchants and travelling dignitaries. Owned and run by a single family. Serves the town's famous honey mead. 
#### The Trickster's Dice
Location - Southwestern outskirts of the town
A poor tavern frequented by gamblers. The guards tend to turn a blind eye, or come when not on duty to gamble and drink. Serves only hard liquor. 
#### Sanctum
Location - Near the centre of town, next to the northern bluff
A standard town sanctum that is used by the locals and nearby villages when they are in need of an apothecary.
#### Market
Location - Stalls are spread out along the main roads anywhere there is space
A collection of market stalls set up by travelling traders. As there is no one market space, they tend to set up wherever they can. 
#### Honeymead Bee Farm
Location - On the edge of the woods to the east of town
A collection of apiaries that produces honey for the town's famous mead. Used to be a whole estate but downsized during the war. 
#### Meadenhill Fort
Location - Half an hour east of town, north of the road
An old fort that has fallen into disrepair. It was used as a garrison during the war and was later occupied by loyalist holdouts.
