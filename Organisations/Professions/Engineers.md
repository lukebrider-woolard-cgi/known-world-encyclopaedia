## Who are they:
Engineers are inventors and crafters who build weapons and armour to use mana, but who themselves are not magically gifted.  
## Organisation:
The first engineers were of course the [[Bortusken]]. Within their hidden home of Stalacforge, magical abilities and spells were curiously rare. Instead, the [[Bortusken]] gained heightened intelligence, which many of their kind put to use inventing marvellous machines, weapons, and transportation methods. When the race was reintroduced to the world, the enterprising upper class saw profit to be made selling these inventions to the rest of the Known World. The demand became so great, that those with great intellect and a creative mind were able to learn the skills necessary to become an engineer. Creations such as firearms are commonly used by engineers. They see these items as force equalisers to help non-magical individuals compete with those with magical powers. The distrust sown between magical and non-magical people during the civil war in the Northern Kingdom has lead to these inventions becoming more widespread. However, the knowledge and skill required to build, maintain, and operate these weapons has kept them out of most people’s hands.  
## Standard D&D Background:
Most are proficient with firearms and some kind of Artisan’s tool.
