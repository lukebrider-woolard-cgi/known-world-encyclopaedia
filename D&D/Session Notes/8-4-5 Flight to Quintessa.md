## Abridged Session Notes
* On the evening that the skyship [[Skyship Albatross|Albatross]] sets sail, Captain Varnis puts on a welcome feast. <mark>The party each receive a bespoke meal organised by Dormian.</mark>
* Also on board as passengers is Lorekeeper Rior Dragonhearth, Darrius and the Rogues (Ga Nuna, Tutel, and Amalie), and a monster hunting couple called Hugo and Nestar.
* [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] continues to cast a protection spell on his room, and [[Lydia]] remains in her cabin most of the journey to play with her orphans who are nervous about the journey.
* [[Sir Kane Kellester|Sir Kane]] spars with and defeats a monster hunter named Hugo. [[Sir Kane Kellester|Sir Kane]] is slightly suspicious as Hugo has maroon coloured irises. 
* <mark>[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] trades information with Lorekeeper Rior (who remembers teaching [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] a few times at Starlight Tower). He explains his previous expedition, gives some of his understanding of the culture of the [[Antanai]], and warns that greedy eyes may have alterior motives for sending the party to find wealth in Quintessa.</mark>
* Mid-way through the journey, the skyship docks at Respite Island. <mark>Tutel seems upset by the sight of Olivencian slaves working in the ship dock below.</mark>
* When they disembark the party are warned by local workers to stay out of the jungle.
* <mark>The party meet two [[Antanai]] emissaries - Furgin and Zorlek. They discuss Quintessa in more detail, though they seem a little cagey when asked about demons. [[Sir Kane Kellester|Sir Kane]] gifts Sir Byzantine's Glaive to Furgin.</mark>
* <mark>[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] learns that Elemental Power Crystals exist on Quintessa, though they are rare. They are used as focusses and power sources for enchantments.</mark>
* [[Magnar]] spots Hugo and Nestar heading into the jungle, so the party follow. They join a fight against some abomination creatures (komeklion) and save Hugo. 
* <mark>Before leaving, Furgin and Zorlek offer to sponsor the two adventuring parties, recommending where they should head. The main party join Furgin, who advises them to head to the borders of the Hidden Marshes and his homeland - the Mournful Highlands.</mark>
* The [[Skyship Albatross|Albatross]] sets off again. North of the Jadesea Isles, a merchant ship is spotted coming under attack from three pirate sloops. The party work with the skyship crew to engage and destroy the pirate ships, ending one with the application of portable cannon balls.
