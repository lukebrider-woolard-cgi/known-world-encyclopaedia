## Notable Locations

A large circular building with a shallow dome roof. The centre of the dome is open. The seat of government for the area and a space for the community to meet and hold events.
#### The Mountain's Roots
Location - Centre of the commune next to the stream
A spacious building that serves as a secondary community space, and provides food and drink to those that need it. Somewhere between a saloon and a boarding house.

An ancient shrine to the elements that is still maintained by the locals. Four stone block arches adorned with windchimes surround a small eternal bonfire. The island can be accessed by stepping stones.

Two windmills operated by Chrysiri work grain shipped to the commune into flour.

## Factions
#### Miners
A group of around twenty Settoln that work in the nearby mines. They and their families make up a large proportion of the commune's population. Mining in these parts is a dangerous job, due to all the tectonic activity. Recently, an earthquake has destroyed the (40 ft) bridge that leads to the mine entrance, causing them to have to take a longer route whilst the bridge is repaired. 
#### Undead
Undead creatures including explorers from Norcernwere and Elencern have been attacking the nearby lands. Several bands of undead have been traversing the area - seemingly scouting. They are originating from the Ruins of Djurnoth.
