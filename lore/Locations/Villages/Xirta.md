## Factions
#### Antanai Outcasts
Antanai who adhere to the 'old ways' of elemental worship or who eschew the expected responsibilities of the rest of their kind. All have made the pilgrimage here to live a reclusive and peaceful life. 
#### Sorcerers Three
One of the sorcerers, who goes by the pseudonym 'Lester Bell' has set up residence in the area and has been interacting with the outcasts. He is pretending to be an elementalist in order to embed himself in the area and find new potential subjects for the group's divine magic experiments.
