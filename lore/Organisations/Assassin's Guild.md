## Who are they:
The Assassins Guild is a collection of officially sanctioned killers working in the shadows.  
## Organisation:
Rather than being bloodthirsty murderers or petty hitmen, the members of the guild are skilled in espionage and subterfuge. They are technically lawful but operate above the law across the Known World; not governed by a single state. Instead, the guild is broken up into offices that each operates out of a particular region or country. Each office tends to align with the local government or people, and both commoners and those in positions of power can attempt to hire the guild’s services. Whether a mark becomes an active target is determined by the commander of the local office. Members of the guild have the potential to become marks themselves, especially if they are operating in a foreign land that is hostile to their own office’s home nation. The commanders of the guild, whilst outwardly friendly with one another, often end up working with and against each other in a confusing game of cat and mouse. To outsiders - and even many guild members - the internal workings and allegiances of the commanders appears altogether mad and ever-changing. And yet, the guild has continued to help steer the course of destiny for centuries.
