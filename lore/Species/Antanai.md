*A caste-based collective of elementally imbued races who reside in the newly discovered continent of Quintessa.*  

During the [[3rd Age - Turmoil|First Demonic War]], the intelligent races of the Known World began to harness magic and fight back against the demon hordes. However, the continent of Quintessa lacked any such protection. Seeking to aid the creatures under assault there, the Elemental Lords each selected a budding aberrant race and magically teleported them to Quintessa. This journey imparted these races with a strong elemental affinity, mutating their bodies and enhancing their intelligence further. This, combined with the ample arcane energies of the continent, manifested a force great enough to rid these undiscovered lands of demons. Over the following centuries, the four races have grown into a caste-based collective known as the Antanai.
## Antanai Culture and Naming
During the centuries since the end of the [[3rd Age - Turmoil|First Demonic War]], the four races brought to Quintessa came together to form a single society. Each race excelled at different tasks thanks to their affinity with the individual elements and, much like the elements, were able to accomplish more when they worked together. Over time, this slowly developed into a caste system where each species of the antanai provides for the whole by performing the tasks and roles best suited to them.   
###### Chrysiri
The air caste of mantis-limbed, moth-like humanoids. They are the millers, singers, and wyvern riders - fickle, flighty, and lively. They have insectoid eyes, antennae, and fine, glittering hair on their heads and around their shoulders. Their short wings cannot sustain flight, and although they have six limbs their middle pair are similarly vestigial. However, they are adept climbers and favour high perches and vantage points - though they never stay in one place for long. This long ago brought them into contact with wyverns, some of which they have tamed over the generations. In groups, the Chrysiri are known to form drop-in drop-out choral choirs. They are the guardians of peaks and plains.  
###### Felonils
The fire caste of lion-like humanoids. They are the smiths, artisans, and scientists of the Antanai - creative and passionate, with mirthful grins and stout hearts. Their manes and fur shimmers and smoulders with yellow, orange, and red flame. They can be very affable, but also tend to have short fuses and are prone to bursts of passion. They are the guardians of the torch and the forges.  
###### Settoln
The earth caste of short, badger-like humanoids. The builders, farmers, and miners of the Antanai - stoic, hardy, patient, and unwavering. Their claws are as hard as diamonds and their course hair has become metallic in quality. The Settoln enjoy quiet comforts and take great pride in a hard day's work. They have keen vision at night and underground, and tend to the earth with care and reverence. They are humble and hearty in nature. They are the guardians of the fields and forests.  
###### Xanthell
The water caste of coral and barnacle-covered hominin. They are lean and lithe, with blue-grey skin and seagrass hair. They are the dancers, fishermen, and sailors of rivers and seas for the Antanai - brooding, calm, and wistful. They are most at home on the water's edge, have dexterous hands and are as graceful as they are nimble. They are best known for their enchanting dances that are accompanied by percussion instruments. They are the guardians of the rivers and marshes. 
###### Other Notes
The antanai use base four mathematics and follow a zodiac calendar system.
#### Governance
To maintain balance, each species sends representatives to sit on a central governing council at the continental capital of Manasong Palace. Every four years, this council elects from its members an Emperor to lead their people. The title of Emperor is rotated through each of the four castes at these elections. This is to avoid any one Emperor from showing bias towards their own species.  
Though they hail from the elements, the majority of the antanai have long since turned to arcane practices. This is seen most notably in the Seers - political figureheads for major antanai settlements that once would have been shamanistic farseers, but are now arcane scholars. The shift away from elemental reverence was so gradual that no one is sure what sparked it, though it is theorised that Quintessa has a strong arcane influence through mana infusions and leylines. Those few traditionalists who hold on to the old ways tend to live in exile from the rest of their kind. They are seen by the majority of the antanai as outcasts and hermits, though some go further to suggest that refusing to contribute to the common good is a treasonous crime.  
Following the discovery of Quintessa by the wider world, the initial meetings between the antanai and other civilisations have been peaceful, fueled by wonder and discovery. However, with such a bountiful land in their possession, it remains to be seen whether this peace will last for long. 
#### Naming
As representatives of a common collective, all Antanai only have a birth name. These names are usually existing words in the Quinthwaith language, so each name has a deeper meaning.
