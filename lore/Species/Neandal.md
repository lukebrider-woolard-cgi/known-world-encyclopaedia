*Neandals are a warrior people, divided into nomadic clans that roam the harsh north of Norcernwere.*  

Neandals once inhabited much of the continent of Norcernwere but were slowly forced north by [[Human|humans]] who had fled Elencern during the [[3rd Age|First Demonic War]]. Most have retained the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors, driven into the tundras and mountains of the far north. As such, they are incredibly hardy, and each member of a clan is expected to pull their weight and learn a trade or skill. Clans often come to blows over territory, and some neandals even resort to raiding, pillaging, and cannibalism in order to survive.  
Neandals are slightly shorter and stockier than humans, with broad noses and sloping foreheads. Contrary to what some may say, the average Neandal is just as intelligent and cultured as their [[human]] counterpart. Their features make them tough, and well-suited to their cold environment - they are barrel-chested, with thicker ribs than humans. They also appear to have less reaction to pain than most other races, with broken bones and contusions barely slowing them down. They can literally walk off injuries that may cripple others, and think nothing of resetting a dislocated digit or limb before continuing whatever it was they were doing before their injury.
## Neandal Cultures and Naming
#### Norcernwere
Most neandals worship the elements, for their survival is often at the mercy of nature's wrath. Their revered dead are ritualistically burned - so that their spirits may go to the fields of honour to fight and feast for eternity. Neandal [[Elementalists]] and shaman are common, possibly due to their proximity to the Smokey Mountain. Just as their ancestors have done for centuries, neandals continue to live in clans made up of extended family units. Eschewing permanent settlements may not simply be because it is necessary for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, but because it allows them to live closer to the elements.
Great variety is shown in things even as simple as the organisation of their temporary settlements. Some clans arrange their tents to have their strongest members on the outskirts so as to protect their weaker kin, whilst for other clans the centre of the camp is a place of pride reserved for their toughest warrior or best hunter. Alternatively, more social clans erect their communal tents and the dwellings of their leaders in the middle of their settlement. 
Upon reaching adolescence, young male clan members are sent out to find a mate in another clan - which the male will become a member of if they are accepted. Some more peaceful clans reconvene annually and make this process into a courting ceremony. This involves several days of introductions and matchmaking before a contest takes place where the men must seek out, chase, and capture their prospective mate. Others expect their young to head out alone to trek the tundras and frozen wastes in search of other clans - if they die in the process, then they were not strong enough to carry the family seed forward anyway.  
It should be noted that not all clans subscribe to this traditional nomadic lifestyle. Some prefer to live within the lands of the Northern Kingdom proper, in permanent settlements alongside their [[human]] cousins. In Evergreen and the Rocky Coast, neandal individuals and families can be found living and working in towns and cities. There are several neandal villages set up around the lochs and tundras to the south of the Frostlands. Some few do venture even further south if they are born with the call to adventure.
###### Naming:
Naming is established as a birth name given by an individual's parents, followed by their clan name (e.g. [[Bjorn Wildskull]]) - males only receive their clan name after they find a mate and are accepted into their new clan. Exiles lose their clan name. Some neandals gain titles through acts of heroism.
