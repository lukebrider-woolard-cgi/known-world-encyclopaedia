*Humans are a crafty, creative, and prolific species who inhabit every corner of the Known World.*

Since the first humans ventured out from the safety and security of the Cradle Lake sometime during the [[2nd Age|2nd Age]], they have travelled to and flourished in almost every corner of the Known World. Very few places present a challenge too great for human determination to overcome, such that today human civilisations exist almost everywhere that is not already inhabited by another. A portion of their success must be attributed to the prevalence of humans with magical capabilities. Whilst magical abilities in the other prime species are rare, around 1 in 20 humans manifest powers upon reaching adolescence. But, perhaps most important of all is the human spirit. Though they may not be as strong as the [[kal krom]], hardy like their [[neandal]] cousins, nor as specialised as the [[olmetek]], the human ability to grow in adversity, learn from their mistakes, and triumph against all odds is what has truly led to their success.  
There is no single way to define human culture, as each civilisation holds its own practices, history, and laws. Some cling stubbornly to tradition, whilst others set out to explore the world and learn the ways of whichever place they find themselves in next. Humans do not collectively hold to a single religious belief system and even within a single society, there may be practitioners of different faiths. Though, humans do have a strong tendency to erect permanent settlements in which can usually be found three key structures, with each reflecting an aspect of life that is important to all humans: an [[Apothecaries|apothecary]] sanctum - to heal and protect the soul, a [[Mages|mage]] tower - to record, distribute, and protect information, and a tavern - in which to share stories.  
Humans are able to become gifted at anything they set their minds to, and most strive to stand out from the crowd and make a name for themselves or their families. Being the most magically gifted species, humans also make up the bulk of the practitioners of each of the different sects of magic. The multitude of cultures, customs, and beliefs in humanity also gives rise to a wide range of morals. Humans are adaptable creatures, able to rise to almost any challenge. Humankind more than most is driven by a desire to learn and explore. Adventurers are far more likely to be human than any of the other species, who often prefer the comforts of their ancestral homes and care not for what lies beyond their borders. Of course, not every human wishes to spread their horizons in the literal sense, but may still wish to master their own destiny and leave a lasting legacy. Perhaps this is why, since ancient times, human civilisations have built and maintained towns and cities rich with culture, so that every individual has the opportunity to leave an impression that stands the test of time.
## Human Cultures and Naming
#### Northern Kingdom:
The Northern Kingdom is a feudal society with many provinces falling under the rule of a single royal family. Other noble families serve as lords and ladies and preside over the individual provinces or large settlements. Each province follows the same laws but maintains a unique blend of its ancient culture mixed with the modern practices of the greater kingdom. The majority of the population revere the Immortals above all others but believe the Elemental Lords created the world. As the Northern Kingdom encompasses much of the continent of Norcernwere, the humans there are varied in accent and appearance. The men of the north tend to have blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin, whilst those of the deserts and swamps to the south are tanned with dark hair and eyes. 

Commoner Names - Birth name, followed by a compound name containing the father or mother’s name if boy or girl respectively, followed by a gendered suffix of either son or den - *e.g. Bob and Mary have a boy and a girl, James Bobson and Jess Maryden.*

Nobility Names - Birth name, followed by a family name. The family name is chosen when first gaining rulership. Marrying into a noble family gains that person the name too, though the rest of their birth family does not.  
#### Refuge:
Refuge is a feudal city-state controlled by several powerful and ancient families. After the [[3rd Age|First Demonic War]], those who had risen to hold positions of military power became the de facto rulers of the lands they defended. Refuge was protected at a high cost and with tough determination, and the people have forever remained stubborn and traditionalistic. Lordship has since been passed down through bloodlines long bereft of any military or governing prowess. Refugeans also maintain a patriarchal society, leftover from when it was necessary to protect those capable of bearing children during the [[3rd Age|First Demonic War]]. The majority of the population revere the Immortals above all others but believe the Elemental Lords created the world. Refugeans are short to average in height, with medium tan skin, brown eyes, and black hair. Facial hair is prized amongst the noblemen.

Commoner Names - Birth name only.  

Nobility Names - Birth name, followed by a patriarchal family name passed down from their warrior ancestors.
#### Oldwood:
Apothecarium Citadel and the surrounding towns and farmsteads all fall under a religious oligarchy. The senior [[apothecaries]] hold positions of power and respect and so govern both their students and the denizens of their country. Due to their history and proximity to the Great Wastes, the people of Oldwood do not maintain a formal army, but instead stand ready to arm themselves at a moment’s notice and form local militias to combat any threat, demonic or otherwise. The entire population worship the Immortals. Humans from Oldwood are shorter than most of their species and have fair skin that is often freckled, green eyes, and auburn hair.

Oldwoodian Names - Birth name, followed by a family name. Most family names have some relation to a title or trade practised by a distant relative. Men keep the family name of their fathers, and women their mothers.  
#### Olivencia:
Olivencia is a plutocratic slave state with a strong focus on commerce and foreign trade. Wealthy families preside over parcels of land and operate their own trade companies and private armies. When needed, a council is formed where each family sends a matriarch or patriarch as a representative to deal with politics and governing. Skill trades are operated by a middle class who are neither members of the elite, nor slaves. These freemen are generally left to their own devices so long as they and their families remain useful. All other denizens are born or sold into slavery. Worship of the Immortals is mandatory. Olivencians vary in size and shape depending on their class, though most tend to have olive skin, green or brown eyes, and brown or black hair.

Slave Naming - Depending on the owner, a slave may be given a pet name or a derogatory one.  

Freeman Naming - Birth name, followed by the surname Freeman.  

Nobility Names - Birth name, followed by a family name. Titles usually centre around the goods the family primarily trades in - *e.g. Seberain Ozeron, Lord of Spice.*  
#### Autumn Isles:
The Autumn Isles are often referred to as the land of balance and enlightenment. They sit on a ley line nexus of both arcane and elemental magic. The saying goes that there is “no water more clear, no air more sweet, no earth more fertile, no fire more hearty.” The islands are full of monasteries, libraries, observatories, and artisan workshops. Scholars, spiritualists, and artists come to the isles from all across the Known World to seek inspiration. The people of the Autumn Isles are predominantly descendants of pilgrims and travellers who chose to settle in these captivating lands, and as such, there is no common ethnicity.

Autumn Islander native names - Infants born on the isles are usually named after gemstones, flowers, or other objects of beauty, followed by the name of the settlement that they hail from.  
#### The Badlands:
The humans of the Badlands are taller and leaner than most humans and have deep skin, dark eyes, and shaved heads.  
#### The Stormy Coast:
Shipwreck city is a freeport and so contains humans and other species from all across the Known World. Those who call it home tend to be very hardy, with dreadlocked hair, ashen skin, and blue or green eyes.  
#### The Overgrowth:
The various and scattered settlements of the Overgrowth are home to humans with golden tan skin, brown eyes, and black hair.
