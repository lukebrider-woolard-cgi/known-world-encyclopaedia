#### Founding of the Northern Kingdom - year 125

The continent of Norcernwere had fared much better than Elencern during the 3rd Age, having been spared from the assaults of the demonic armies that spilled out of the Great Wastes. During this time, neandals and kal krom were present on the continent, and were later joined by small waves of human refugees. However, each of these prime species maintained cultures that were small enough to go mostly unnoticed by demonic forces, until word spread from the south that the war had finally been won. This revelation allowed the human settlements within Norcernwere to grow, until their cultural borders formed broadly into the provinces we know today. Some of these civilisations held neutral relations with their neighbours, or even traded from time to time. However, wars were also not uncommon - both internally and between the various chiefdoms and tribes.

At the beginning of the 2nd century, a new power arose within the fertile lands of Greenhart. A warrior named [[Forela Grimsbane]] set out on a conquest of her neighbouring warlords. A ferocious and cunning fighter, Forela won many victories against difficult odds. Yet, she showed a compassionate yet firm leadership of the people under her rule, and was very adept at diplomacy and politics thanks in no small part to a wise council of lieutenants and advisors, including her trusted friend [[Eri Dragonhearth]]. This allowed Forela to gain the support of several groups by defeating their oppressors - earning her a reputation as a saviour and liberator, rather than a conqueror. As her followers and triumphs grew, she came to be viewed as a Warrior Queen. 
Upon reaching the coast, she established a township for her people that contained her seat of power, from which she could now rule over the whole of Greenhart. This town, Twynburh, would continue to grow over the coming centuries, and would eventually become the capital of the Northern Kingdom when Forela's descendants brought other provinces under their influence. 

#### The Plague of Undeath - year 721

A demon - posing as a farmer in the Norcernwere province of the Wold - infected meat with a deadly plague, intending for it to be shipped from the city of Fjord and released upon the world. The goal was simple: create so much death so quickly that [[apothecaries]] would be overwhelmed so that souls could not be warded and a new army of demons could spawn. However, the meat was purchased by Lady [[Vena Holton]] and sent to a local orphanage. Devastation rapidly followed as hundreds fell sick within a week. Death spread through the Wold and into the surrounding regions, sowing panic and fear. The [[Apothecaries|Apothecary]] [[Gordio]] worked in the heart of the afflicted region, attempting to find a cure. His work became more desperate as his wife contracted the plague. Likely being affected by the illness himself, [[Gordio]] inadvertently mutated the disease, fusing it with a spell that bound souls to their dead bodies, causing the plague to reanimate the dead. This new ‘Plague of Undeath’ spread through the remaining population of the Wold, not just killing people, but eradicating all life and leaving only rot and pestilence in its wake. The only survivors were those who turned to dark powers, keeping themselves alive at a terrible price. Lady Holton established the order of the Watchers and fortified the town of Bridgton into the renamed Holton Citadel. The bridge fortress being the last bulwark stopping the army of the dead from heading south into the fertile lands of Greenhart. To the north, the narrow coastal passage to the Rocky Coast was bombarded continuously by the Royal Navy, and so the entire undead horde was forced to march on the citadel. After an incredibly bloody and drawn-out siege, the fallen were finally forced back. However, it was a hollow victory, as to this day the plague lingers and thrives in the devastated lands now named the Deadwold. The Necromancers turned the old provincial capital into their malignant fortress known as the Blight. Lady Holton’s Watchers raised watchtowers and continued to patrol its borders, keeping a careful watch to keep the plague from escaping.    

#### The First Beastwalker - year 733

A youth named [[Howlan Whitefang|Harlan]] was attacked by an abnormally large wolf in the Elencern town of Sanctuary Grove. Against all odds, he was able to defeat the beast with his bare hands but was gravely wounded in the fight. During a double full moon the boy, wracked by fever, dreamt that he became a wolf himself and slaughtered local livestock. When he finally recovered from his wounds he found that the town was on the hunt for a second wolf that had killed their goats. Worried that he may be going mad, [[Howlan Whitefang|Harlan]] was once again taken by a fever at the next double moon, but this time was caught transforming into a wolf by his family. In a feral state, he killed his parents, younger brother, and half the town guards before escaping into Wildwood. Whilst searching for a cure [[Howlan Whitefang|Harlan]] was approached by a group of Herdeer, who explained that this magic is not a curse, but a gift. His transformations are controlled by his will alone and stem from when his soul was bound with the wolf’s during unarmed combat. They explain that mana can cause beasts to become infused with magical potential, making them grow larger, stronger, and more cunning. These beasts can be challenged to unarmed, ritual combat by a [[Beastwalkers|beastwalker]] who, if victorious, can absorb the fallen beast’s soul to gain their form. They also warn that prolonged time in animal form will risk unsavoury side effects, and would eventually lead to him becoming more feral and losing his humanity altogether. It was not unheard of that people had been able to better understand, and even commune with beasts. But [[Howlan Whitefang|Harlan]] was the first to survive this ritualistic transformation and discover the truth behind these strange nature magics. He set out to teach the world of this new branch of magic so that no one else would suffer the losses he did.  

#### Stalicforge Rebellion - year 740

The Savage Hills of Elencern are inhabited by - among other things - a race of pig men known as the [[Bortusken]]. So close is this land to the Great Wastes that all who dwell there are barbaric and mad. It was a shock then when [[Bortusken]] corpses, clothed in formal attire and battle armour, washed up on the shores of the Cradle in Oldwood. An expedition soon discovered that these bodies had been carried downstream from a mountain deep within High Peaks. During the [[3rd Age|First Demonic War]], a group of early [[Bortusken]] found refuge within the caves of this mountain and found a font of magical energy deep within the earth. This greatly enhanced the intelligence of these refugees, and they soon built a civilisation within their new mountain home, calling it Stalicforge - so-called because the city wraps around a great stalactite. They had become a nation of adept geologists, cutting gems to reflect sunlight into their deepest tunnels, and mining a wealth of ores and minerals from the bountiful mountains. The [[Bortusken]] culture divides the race into three classes, the upper class - in charge of governing, the middle class - keen inventors, and jewel and metalsmiths, and the lower class - miners and farmers. Each class also inhabits the respective depths of their underground city. Civil unrest in the lower reaches of the mines had led to a war between the upper and lower classes, inadvertently creating the bodies that had washed out of the mountain to be discovered by the world. This proved beneficial for all involved, as the [[Bortusken]] nobility found they were naturally gifted at brokering trade deals. After all, it is easy to get the best deal stone for stone when you know which rocks are heaviest.  

#### The Mage King - year 748

[[Calavar Lancast]] is crowned King of the Northern Kingdom. A powerful [[Mages|Mage]], he begins his reign by raising the esteem of other magically gifted [[Human|humans]], especially the order of [[Mages]]. This is done to the detriment of non magically gifted citizens and is seen as xenophobic towards other races. Though this oppression is light at first, it grows quickly over the coming years.  

#### Preparations for Expansion - year 752

Under the leadership of King Lancast, the Northern Kingdom purchases technology created by [[Bortusken]] [[engineers]] - including sky ship prototypes, and the first bombs, rifles, and cannons. A few intrepid [[Bortusken]] are brought to Twynburh to oversee the development of new munitions factories and defences, as well as to assist in the construction of the new Royal Sky Fleet. King Lancast intends to bring Elencern under his leadership and sends a force in relative secret to invade the northern shores of Razorleaf Jungle, to establish a beachhead and gain access to resources. Local settlements become immediately hostile, and ambassadors from Terracotta City soon disappear in Twynburh. Though the majority of the population remains in the dark, the Northern Kingdom is now at war.  

#### The Inquisition - year 753

Growing unrest within the Kingdom leads to Calvar creating [[the Inquisition]], an order devoted to his cause and composed of powerful Battlemages. They are charged with rooting out treason and keeping the peace by any means they deem necessary.  

#### Civil War - year 756

[[Inquisitor Alabastia]] is sent to Evergreen to bring Lord Whitewall back in line after he refuses to supply wood and food to the war effort. The Inquisitor - hungry for power - instead stages a coup of the province. This, combined with plans to dam the river at Green Mist Falls results in rebellion, which soon spirals into a Civil War within the Northern Kingdom. Some provinces remain loyal to the crown - either through natural loyalty, or the careful placement of sympathetic [[Mages]], or Inquisitors. However, many non-magical people and those trained in other forms of magic besides arcane join the rebels. Calvar begins to see treason everywhere. Panicked, he denounces all magic, and orders the assassinations of many prominent spellcasters, trusting only his Inquisition and Battlemage Royal Guard.  

#### Battle of Menan Falls - year 758

Spies discover that rebel leaders, including the King’s brother Prince [[Gren Lancast]], are holding a strategy meeting at the fort near Menan Falls in the Great Plains. Rumours spread that they are even planning on approaching the local Bovine hordes for aid. A squadron of ships from the Royal Sky Fleet is sent to destroy the settlement, but they are defeated at the hands of powerful [[Elementalists]]. Flight Lieutenant [[Bilrey Damart]] - witnessing his brother’s death - swears revenge against all magical people. He takes the surviving skyships into the mountains of the Belt and forms the Sky Pirates. News of the war has spread to all corners of the world, and the masters of Terracotta City, aware of King Lancast’s plans for domination, formally declare themselves against him and provide soldiers and ships for the rebellion.  

#### Battle of the Heath - year 758

A loyalist army that had been sent to aid in the assault on Menan Falls is recalled after their air support is destroyed. Hoping to catch the loyalists before they can retreat to Greenhart, the rebels send cavalry units to chase them down. The hope is that if this army can be defeated, the rebels will gain momentum towards ending the war. Instead, the rebel cavalry is massacred as the loyalists deploy the world's first 'pike and shot' formations. 

#### Siege of the Crossroads - year 759

To begin hampering supply lines in Greenhart, rebel forces attempt to secure the town of [[Crossroads]]. The noble family Oakspring stubbornly resists from their hilltop hold despite complete encirclement, and in the ensuing assaults and skirmishes many homes in the once vibrant market town are destroyed. It is a painful foreshadowing of the civilian cost to come in the closing months of the war.

#### Siege of Twynburh and the Viaduct Massacre - year 760

Rebel forces surround Twynburh, but the capital city is prepared for months of siege. A diversion at the main gate is planned, hoping to draw away enough guards that a small team can infiltrate the city’s canal lock. However, thousands of refugees have made camp on the viaduct, and in the ensuing crossfire, many civilians are killed. Despite this, the covert team led by Prince Lancast succeed in their task and assault the Palace from the Servant’s District. One of the most powerful and destructive battles the world has seen takes place in the throne room between the rebels and Royal Guard. Despite heavy losses, the Prince and a small band of heroic fighters manage to push their way through to the Monarch’s Tower. There, they confront the King, who towers above them from within a suit of arcanic armour. Only through extreme heroism and sacrifice is the day won. The war continues for several weeks as the last few loyalists hold out, and [[the Inquisition]] continues to fight a guerrilla war for many years to come.  

#### Kingdom at Peace - year 761

Prince Gren Lancast is crowned King. General stigma against mages people leads to a new law, forbidding any royalty born with magical powers from ascending to the throne to prevent one person from holding too much power. Despite the new monarch, the war has left the Kingdom uneasy. Neighbour had fought neighbour, and the lies and propaganda spread by [[the Inquisition]] have left the public mistrustful of one another. Even foreign relations have been strained by the expansionist efforts of the Northern Kingdom during the war. What’s worse, older enemies sense weakness and start to gather their forces. 
The nobility of the Northern Kingdom undergoes many changes, as loyalist families are demoted or removed from power, to be replace with rebel leaders and allies of Gren Lancast. The High Lords are made to swear fealty to their new king, and though all can agree that the time for peace and stability has come, not all are happy about an allegiance with the Kingdom they had rebelled against.
