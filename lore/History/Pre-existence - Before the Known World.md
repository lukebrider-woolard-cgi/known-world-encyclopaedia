## The Origin of the Elements
First, there came the Immortals. Great, incomprehensible beings that live in peace and harmony within their realm - the Plane of Undying. All was well until one group of Immortals - the Elemental Lords - began an eternal war with one another. Each Lord holds dominion over an alchemical element and controls the laws that define it. Ryolith the fire Lord is a being of incredible heat, whose mass of molten rock and liquid fire is covered in a cracked armour of granite. Within its head exists a shard of pure, white-hot energy that is barely contained behind its obsidian teeth. Nimbor, the Lord of air is without a singular form and instead manifests as an ever-shifting fog, wreathed in lightning. It can dissipate and reappear at will, phasing from an invisible breeze into a black, swirling vortex in seconds. Abysil is the Lord of water, and it too has an ever-changing body. Silky clear skin can morph into a raging, frothing mass. Atop its head is a crown of diamond-hard ice, and its face falls into itself as a bottomless whirlpool. Tecton, the Lord of earth is a giant of rocky boulders, and vast, rigid plates. When it moves, the ground on its body breaks and cracks with the force of the largest earthquakes. Each Lord sought to prove that they were the greatest, and to this end, each summoned forth legions of minions: smaller avatars of themselves. So began the great war of the Elements. For aeons, the Lords and their minions waged their battle for domination. But no one element could undo the others, so evenly matched and skilled were they. Their armies did not dwindle, for the Lords could call forth more with but a mere the wave of a hand. However, though they could not best one another, the destruction wrought upon the Plane of Undying was near total. This calamity left their fellow Immortals no choice. They created a new realm and banished the Elementals there. The Lords and their minions found themselves in a place of sheer darkness, devoid of all light and matter. The vast emptiness, when compared to the unparalleled beauty of the Plane of Undying, shocked the Elemental Lords to their core. Such was this punishment that for the first time in countless millennia of war the Lords fell still and silent. Filled with remorse and shame, their selfishness had undone all of them, and so knowing that they could not best each other the great Elemental Lords formed an unspoken, eternal truce.  

Further millennia passed while the Elemental Lords maintained a state of silent self-pity. However, their surviving minions - possessing no sentience of their own - quickly grew restless. Without their masters controlling them, they began to wage war once again. Eventually, the Elemental Lords were forced out of their hibernation and peace resumed once more. However, the Lords were surprised to note that when the proverbial dust settled, it was not as proverbial as it ought to be. With nothing in existence to be destroyed the battling minions had created matter within the unending dark abyss. The Elemental Lords came together to take stock of what their minions had wrought. Where Ryolith and Abysil’s minions had battled, sheets of crystals and minerals of every colour now stood. Nimbor’s minions had carved great valleys and crags out of the rocky formations blasted into existence by Tecton’s followers. Water rushed into these valleys, creating rivers and lakes. Fire boiled up the water, and the air carried it away to be rained back down elsewhere. But strangest of all was what happened when this new land had felt the touch of all elements together. The Lords looked and saw small beings wriggling to life. Delicate and flimsy though they were, it was a start. After an eternity of living in a realm of nothingness, such beauty humbled the Elemental Lords. They found they were able to create, not just destroy. And so it came to pass, that this second realm became known as the Mortal Plane.
