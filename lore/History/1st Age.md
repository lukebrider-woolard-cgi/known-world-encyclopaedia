## The Founding Era

Individual planes for each element. 

### The Creation of The Known World

The Elemental Lords experimented further, and soon beheld an entire world of their creation. But this first attempt failed quickly and unexpectedly. The waters dried out, the air faded, and life died out leaving a barren ball of rock. A second world was created, and this one lasted longer, life took hold stronger than before. It was then that the Lords realised the problem. Left unchecked, the minions they commanded to create, now also had something to destroy. Before long, the second world lay silent and dark. Their third attempt was even grander than before, and the Lords used their powers to create a vast world. Abysil filled it with rivers, lakes and oceans. Tecton ensured the ground was deep and strong. Nimbor blew clouds into the sky and winds down over the land. And Ryolith, for the first and only time in its life, opened its great maw, and let forth a ball of white-hot light into the heavens. It decreed that this light become known as the Sun. The Lords also decreed that the two barren worlds be left as moons - Lunaxa and Lunina - to provide an eternal warning of the perils of their unchecked power. Next, the Elementals planned to descend into the centre of the world, taking their minions with them and locking them away within a new realm known henceforth as the Elemental Plane. But, they did not wish to leave their budding new world unwatched and unguarded. Before their departure, they needed to design creatures that would watch over the world in their absence.    

### The Guardians

Ryolith created the Dragons - fire breathing, winged, and noble beasts. Nimbor left the Banshees - creatures of terrible beauty - to watch over the skies and high places. Tecton raised the Stone Titans - beings which would sleep deep within mountains, and rise to roam about the land when needed. And Abysil created the Sea Witches to protect the oceans, from the shallows to the crushing depths. Each would watch over and care for the natural order governed by the laws of their Lord. But, who would care for the life that was, slowly but surely, spreading its tendrils across the face of this new world? The Lords, in their wisdom, decided that if their combined powers created life, then the final guardians should be made through collaboration. The four came together and created the paired Bovine and Herdeer. Whilst the other guardians were immortal - rebirthing themselves upon completing their long lives- the Bovine and Herdeer were destined to watch over nature, and so would live, mate, and die as all other mortals did. When the Lords descended to their eternal rest, they knew that their creations would be well looked after by their guardian demigods.
