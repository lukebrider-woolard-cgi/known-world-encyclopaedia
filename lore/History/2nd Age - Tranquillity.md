## Life Flourishes 
For an unknown length of time, life in the Known World prospered. From the first ancient creatures, all manner of life evolved. Plants grew into trees, which grew into forests. Empty oceans filled with fish, marine reptiles, and all manner of sea creatures. Birds filled the skies, and even the deepest caves felt nature’s touch from insects and fungi. And at long last, on the shores of a lake that would one day be known as the Cradle, a primitive race of humanoids emerged. This race began to expand ever outward and divided into many of the sentient races that exist today. During this time, there were no earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or violent storms. The Elemental Lords held their minions in check, and the demigod races kept their sworn vigil over the land. For aeons, life was allowed to grow in harmony and peace and with nature.  
## The Coming Doom
Back in the Plane of Undying, the new world had not gone unnoticed by the Immortals. Seeing the pure good that the Elemental Lords had created, they were filled with joy, and bestowed a godly gift upon the Mortal Realm: they allowed the souls of dead mortals to journey to the Plane of Undying. During a mortal creature’s life, their soul would fill with life energies. Every experience and dream, every encounter with another life. Even carnivores hunting and killing - as part of the natural order - would impart a small piece of their prey’s soul onto theirs. Until at last a mortal’s body would die, freeing their soul from their corporeal form. Their life essence would pass to the realm of the Immortals, to live forever. However, this journey is not without risk. When the Immortals created what would become the Mortal Realm, they could never have foreseen that their actions would create a realm between realms. A dark, seething nether of immaterial chaos. A vast nothingness between realms of life and beauty. To travel to the Immortal Plane, souls must first traverse through the Void. Such rich and bright specks of pure life energy did not go unnoticed for long and would stir an ancient evil from deep within the nether. Great, malignant beings known as the Harbingers call the void its home. It is unclear how these entities came into being. It is possible that they too are outcasts from the Plane of Undying, or they could be more ancient than the Immortals themselves. What is clear is that these beings hate all of creation, both immortal and mortals alike. The Harbingers began to feed on whatever souls they could ensnare, immediately developing an insatiable hunger for the life essence of mortals. They found that not all souls are equal. Those of sentient beings grew brighter and stronger than mere beasts, and the demigod Bovine and Herdeer were sweeter still. Each soul gave the Harbingers power, but it was not yet enough for them to assault the Plane of Undying. Focussing their efforts on claiming more souls, they set about creating armies of demons, with which to invade the material realm of mortals and enslave the Known World for harvest.
