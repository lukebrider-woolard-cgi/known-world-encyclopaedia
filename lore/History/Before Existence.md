## The Origin of All Things

### The Plane of Undying

The Immortal Realm is a mythological dimension outside of our understanding. Evidence for its existence is debatable - often simply the stuff of faith or legend. However, any alternative explanations seem for now to be more unlikely still. It may exist, or it may be nothing more than a convenient syndrome for phenomena that we mortals cannot explain. Nevertheless, references to the Immortal Realm appear in the earliest known oral and written traditions, spanning cultural and geographical boundaries across the Known World. Still, the uncertainty around the Plane of Undying has vexed scholars for as long as their profession has existed, for we cannot know the true origin of the Immortal Realm or the beings who dwell there. So, for simplicities' sake, we compile the common aspects of the many myths and legends and spin them into an accepted account.

Most cultures agree that the Plane of Undying is a realm of peace and harmony. Before the Known World, it was inhabited solely by divine beings known simply as the Immortals. They are everlasting and possessed of power that is all but incomprehensible to mortals. The vast majority of the Immortals are unknown to us, having remained within their domain for all of existence. However, it seems that several have been exiled from this paradise, and these few are known to us. 

### The Elemental Lords

It is widely held that one group of Immortals - the Elemental Lords - began an eternal war with one another. Each of these lords holds dominion over an alchemical element, controlling the laws that define it. 

Ryolith, Lord of Fire, is a being of incredible heat, whose mass of molten rock and liquid flame is covered in a cracked armour of granite. Within its head exists a shard of pure, white-hot energy that is barely contained behind its obsidian teeth. 

Nimbor, Lord of Air, is without a singular form. It can dissipate and reappear at will, phasing from an invisible breeze into a black vortex of debris and lightning. 

Abysil, Lord of Water, also has an ever-changing body. Silky clear skin can morph into a raging, frothing mass depending on its mood. Atop its head is a crown of diamond-hard ice, and its face is a swirling whirlpool. 

Tecton, Lord of Earth, is a giant amalgamation of rocky boulders covered in rigid stone plates. When it moves, its body breaks and cracks with the force of the largest earthquakes. 

Each of the Elemental Lords sought to prove that they were the greatest of their kin. This lends evidence to the idea that the Immortals are not omniscient, and certainly indicates that they can be flawed - lacking benevolence. In any case, each lord summoned forth legions of minions - avatars of the various forms their element can take. For aeons, the lords and their minions waged a war for domination over one another. But, no one element could undo the others. However, their armies did not dwindle, for the lords could call forth more minions on a merest whim. So, the destruction wrought upon the Plane of Undying was near total. This calamity left their fellow Immortals no choice. They banished the Elementals from the Immortal Realm and cast them out into an empty void. 

The lords and their minions found themselves in a place of sheer darkness, devoid of all light and matter. The vast nothingness, when compared to the unparalleled beauty of the Plane of Undying, shocked the Elemental Lords to their core. Such was this punishment that the lords fell still and silent, filled with remorse and shame for the selfishness that had been their undoing. Finally realising that their war had won them nothing but exile, the Elemental Lords formed an unspoken, eternal truce.  

### The Spark of Existence

Further millennia passed while the Elemental Lords maintained a state of silent self-pity. However, their minions quickly grew restless, and without their masters controlling them they began to wage war once again. Eventually, this feuding awoke the Elemental Lords from their stupor. They regained control over their minions and silence fell on the void once again. However, the lords were shocked to discover that when the proverbial dust settled, it was not as proverbial as it ought to be. With nothing in existence to be destroyed, their battling minions had created matter. 

The Elemental Lords came together to take stock of what their minions had wrought. Where Ryolith and Abysil’s minions had battled, deposits of crystals and minerals now stood. Nimbor’s minions had carved great crags out of the rocky formations blasted into existence by Tecton’s followers. Water rushed into these gaps, creating valleys and rivers and lakes. Fire boiled up the water, and the air carried it away to be rained back down elsewhere. After an eternity of living in a realm of unending nothingness, such beauty humbled the Elemental Lords. They discovered that they possessed the ability to create, not just destroy. Most importantly of all, where this newly created land had felt the combined touch of all the elements, tiny specks and blobs had begun to wriggle and swim in the primordial soup. Life. Delicate and flimsy, it might have been, but it was a start. This empty dimension was empty no longer, and now it had a purpose. It had become the Mortal Realm.
