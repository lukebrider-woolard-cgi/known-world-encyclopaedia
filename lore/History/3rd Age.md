## The Turmoil Era

### The Demonic War
On the continent that would one day be called Elencern, a lush woodland peninsula in the far south was suddenly thrown into turmoil. A hole was torn in the fabric of reality, and legions of demons and nether spawn were released into our world. Beasts were slaughtered for sport, and sentient mortals were butchered in droves. The chaos was such that the Elemental Lords awoke from their slumber, and felt they could no longer leave nature to fend for itself. They desperately tried to slow the tide of demons. The ground cracked in great fissures, fire erupted from the mountains, and colossal waves were driven inland by ferocious storms. The world was like a body fighting a disease. But it was not enough. The demigods joined the fight, holding back the armies of the Nether long enough for mortals to flee north. But ground was lost with every battle. Immortal creatures that had lived for countless lifetimes were snuffed from existence in a cruel and thoughtless war. But it was not enough. The elements could cut off advances and force demons into bottlenecks, and the demigods could give their lives to save mortals. But the demons had numbers on their side. And for every soul slain, more demons filled the ranks of the enemy. What the mortal realm needed was more soldiers to fight back. But even the sentient races were still too primitive to put up any resistance.  In desperation, the Elemental Lords had only one choice - a decision that would forever change the Mortal Plane. They combined their power, and in a mighty eruption that shattered an entire island, they released magic into the world. Mana shot high and enveloped the skies - forming the stars of the Constellation Arcana. A great rain of fiery rock descended from the heavens down onto the land. Great meteorites and geodes crashed all around, embuing sites across the Known World with power. This mana gifted the prime races magical abilities and allowing them to finally join the fight and assist the demigods in driving back the great enemy. Magic manifested in many ways. Heightened intelligence lead to technological improvements: metallurgy, agriculture, and medicine appeared simultaneously across the Known World. Some mortals were able to wield the power of the elements themselves, whilst others gained incredible arcane abilities. The appearance of healing magics and soul warding also began to starve the demons of their reinforcements. Life was able to once again endure for prolonged periods, allowing cultures to bloom. For some humanoids and beasts, their infusion with magic was so complete that their powers eclipsed all others, even the demigod guardian races. These new gods and saints were immortal unless slain and they soon became known far and wide as champions, patrons, and protectors. Though the scales were starting to tip, decades or perhaps even centuries of warfare were still to come. Budding civilisations rose, only to fall again when they became too populous. Some would disappear almost overnight, whilst others would leave fragmented histories and mythology behind. Perhaps the demons were pruning rising powers in targeted strikes or rising from within societies that grew careless with the souls of their dead. However, slowly but surely this once unstoppable foe was driven back to the lands from which it had first appeared - now called the Great Wastes. This land had felt such unworldly unrest that reality itself had been distorted and altered. Mortals and demigods alike who entered were driven insane by the horrors they witnessed, and survivors who made it back were tormented with waking nightmares for the rest of their days. Daring to go no further, a great fortress citadel was constructed on the borders of the Wastes, to prevent demons from returning.  
### Peace without peace.
Despite this great victory, the world was forever changed. Drained of much of their powers, the Elemental Lords were no longer able to hold complete control over their minions. Even peaceful lands untouched by conflict were soon affected by extreme weather and restless seas. Mountain belts creaked and groaned, and entire forests were burnt away by drought and fire. A few demons lingered on, slipping into the wilderness to corrupt nature, or disguise themselves amongst mortal populations - working their dark influence for centuries to come. The release of magic also had profound side effects on some of the demigod races, mutating them and causing many to become violent towards those they were sworn to protect.  
A great number of the saints and gods that had arisen in the war had laid down their lives in the defence of mortals. Despite their deaths, some of the most well-known gods have lingered on - sometimes even until the present day - through the magic of belief. These patron gods and saints continue to exist as spiritual avatars which, though not as powerful as they were in life, can continue to guide and protect the people who believe in them. Only a scant few gods and saints survived the war, and whilst most continue to be beacons of divinity, some became corrupted by their power. During the war, dragons passed on their knowledge of magic to a group of early [[Human|humans]] that became known as the Dragonhearth clan. They taught control and restraint, before hiding themselves away in the farthest corners of the land. And so it was that protection of this world was passed onto mortals.
