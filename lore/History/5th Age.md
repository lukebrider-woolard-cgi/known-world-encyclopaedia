## The Discovery Era

### An Age of Heroes
Following the turmoil of the last few years, armies and navies now lie in ruins. Many heroes and indeed villains have been born from the fires of war. Some become adventurers, who seek to find riches and glory from amongst the ashes of the past. Instead of nations, it is these intrepid individuals who will shape the world going forward. In light of increasing industrialisation, a new demonic assault, and the prevalence of adventurers dictating world events, mages and scholars announce that the 5th Age has begun.

### Major Events
#### 2nd Demonic War - year 1
An insidious group known as the Cult of the Eternal Night has been fermenting in the shadows of societies across the Known World. Few take the disappearances or chaos caused by the cult seriously. Whether by intent or manipulation, many cultists and several other disenfranchised groups are gathered in the Frostlands under the direction of [[the seven Harbingers]]. Though the prophesied doom is not fully realised, the ensuing ritual does still open a new portal to the Nether. The frozen land is hewn apart into a great rift - later named the Needles. This void nexus opens a new front for demons in Norcernwere. In a two-pronged assault on the world, demons march forth from the Needles and from the Great Wastes in the south of Elencern. Nethergorge Citadel and the city of Northwatch simultaneously bear the brunt of this new assault on the Mortal Realm. Abominations and hidden demons across the world also appear from the shadows to wreak havoc. 
#### New Lands Found - year 2
At the beginning of the 5th Age, Howland Whitefang sets out on a voyage to investigate a fairytale of the eastern migration of the great eagles. He is able to confirm that there is indeed more to the Known World. On his return, he informs the civilisations of Norcernwere and Elencern of his discovery of a third continent - Quintessa. The land is home to the [[Antanai]] - a caste-based collective that seems to have originated with a deep connection to the elements, though many have since eschewed this bond for arcane power.   Elsewhere, many [[Neandal|neandals]] search for new lands to call home, having been displaced by the demons spilling forth from the Needles. Some turn to their [[human]] neighbours for help, whilst others resort to following a mythological journey undertaken by their ancient ancestors. They board a fleet of ships and sail west, eventually rediscovering the [[neandal]] filled lands of Vetenwol.  
#### Discovery of Deep Home - year 5
A catastrophic earthquake and tsunami smashes the city of Alesund in the Stormy Coast. However, in the wake of the devastation an unexplored cave system is unearthed on one of the nearby islands. Apprentice [[Mages|Mage]] [[Eve Shadowfire]] is sent to investigate. She employs the help of Earth Warden [[Bjorn Wildskull]] in case the earthquake was not an isolated incident. Delving deep into the earth, the pair are assaulted by all manner of horrifying creatures but finally find an ancient ritual site created by the Stone Titans - the demigods of the element of earth. Whilst studying the site, legions of Stone Giants begin to awaken, and Bjorn loses his mind to the power of the elemental spirits. Eve is forced to kill her friend and flood the site with seawater, drowning the Stone Giants and destroying the ruins. She barely escapes with her life.  
#### Quest of the Harpy Queen - year 7
Sometime after the formation of the [[Beastwalkers]], Howland Whitefang’s closest friend Xena Blackcrow becomes fed up with his restraint, claiming he is caging the beast within. She takes more than half of their followers with her in a bloody revolt. Xena and her fellow [[Beastwalkers|harpies]] seek to practice bestial magic more fully, and they deliberately seek out powerful creatures to bind their souls with. The group turn increasingly feral over the years, and Xena begins searching for the elusive Wyverns. She eventually tracks one down and begins to battle it in ritual combat. However, she is interrupted by Howland. Though she is more than a match for him, he is aided by one of the few remaining sane Dragons. Xena is forced to retreat but vows revenge.
