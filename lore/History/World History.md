# Major Events in The Known World

## Before Existence - The Origin of All Things

### The Plane of Undying

The Immortal Realm is a mythological dimension outside of our understanding. Evidence for its existence is debatable - often simply the stuff of faith or legend. However, any alternative explanations seem for now to be more unlikely still. It may exist, or it may be nothing more than a convenient syndrome for phenomena that we mortals cannot explain. Nevertheless, references to the Immortal Realm appear in the earliest known oral and written traditions, spanning cultural and geographical boundaries across the Known World. Still, the uncertainty around the Plane of Undying has vexed scholars for as long as their profession has existed, for we cannot know the true origin of the Immortal Realm or the beings who dwell there. So, for simplicities' sake, we compile the common aspects of the many myths and legends and spin them into an accepted account.

Most cultures agree that the Plane of Undying is a realm of peace and harmony. Before the Known World, it was inhabited solely by divine beings known simply as the Immortals. They are everlasting and possessed of power that is all but incomprehensible to mortals. The vast majority of the Immortals are unknown to us, having remained within their domain for all of existence. However, it seems that several have been exiled from this paradise, and these few are known to us.

### The Elemental Lords

It is widely held that one group of Immortals - the Elemental Lords - began an eternal war with one another. Each of these lords holds dominion over an alchemical element, controlling the laws that define it.

Ryolith, Lord of Fire, is a being of incredible heat, whose mass of molten rock and liquid flame is covered in a cracked armour of granite. Within its head exists a shard of pure, white-hot energy that is barely contained behind its obsidian teeth.

Nimbor, Lord of Air, is without a singular form. It can dissipate and reappear at will, phasing from an invisible breeze into a black vortex of debris and lightning.

Abysil, Lord of Water, also has an ever-changing body. Silky clear skin can morph into a raging, frothing mass depending on its mood. Atop its head is a crown of diamond-hard ice, and its face is a swirling whirlpool.

Tecton, Lord of Earth, is a giant amalgamation of rocky boulders covered in rigid stone plates. When it moves, its body breaks and cracks with the force of the largest earthquakes.

Each of the Elemental Lords sought to prove that they were the greatest of their kin. This lends evidence to the idea that the Immortals are not omniscient, and certainly indicates that they can be flawed - lacking benevolence. In any case, each lord summoned forth legions of minions - avatars of the various forms their element can take. For aeons, the lords and their minions waged a war for domination over one another. But, no one element could undo the others. However, their armies did not dwindle, for the lords could call forth more minions on a merest whim. So, the destruction wrought upon the Plane of Undying was near total. This calamity left their fellow Immortals no choice. They banished the Elementals from the Immortal Realm and cast them out into an empty void.

The lords and their minions found themselves in a place of sheer darkness, devoid of all light and matter. The vast nothingness, when compared to the unparalleled beauty of the Plane of Undying, shocked the Elemental Lords to their core. Such was this punishment that the lords fell still and silent, filled with remorse and shame for the selfishness that had been their undoing. Finally realising that their war had won them nothing but exile, the Elemental Lords formed an unspoken, eternal truce.

### The Spark of Existence

Further millennia passed while the Elemental Lords maintained a state of silent self-pity. However, their minions quickly grew restless, and without their masters controlling them they began to wage war once again. Eventually, this feuding awoke the Elemental Lords from their stupor. They regained control over their minions and silence fell on the void once again. However, the lords were shocked to discover that when the proverbial dust settled, it was not as proverbial as it ought to be. With nothing in existence to be destroyed, their battling minions had created matter.

The Elemental Lords came together to take stock of what their minions had wrought. Where Ryolith and Abysil’s minions had battled, deposits of crystals and minerals now stood. Nimbor’s minions had carved great crags out of the rocky formations blasted into existence by Tecton’s followers. Water rushed into these gaps, creating valleys and rivers and lakes. Fire boiled up the water, and the air carried it away to be rained back down elsewhere. After an eternity of living in a realm of unending nothingness, such beauty humbled the Elemental Lords. They discovered that they possessed the ability to create, not just destroy. Most importantly of all, where this newly created land had felt the combined touch of all the elements, tiny specks and blobs had begun to wriggle and swim in the primordial soup. Life. Delicate and flimsy, it might have been, but it was a start. This dimension was empty no longer, and now it had a purpose. It had become the Mortal Realm.

## 1st Age - The Founding Era

### The Creation of The Known World

The Elemental Lords began a grand experiment, determined to see how far they could develop this newfound discovery. However, as would become a precedent followed by many a scientist or inventor in more recent history, their initial efforts were met with failure. Their first attempts yielded a sizable world, yet it was soon overcome by imbalance. The waters dried and the air faded, until nothing was left but a dust-covered ball of barren, orange rock that could not sustain life.

Terrified that their meddling may once again have been their undoing, the lords took greater care with their second attempt. Their caution was partially rewarded, as this world lasted longer. Life took hold stronger than before, flourishing into larger and more diverse forms. The care they were taking allowed the lords to notice a problem they had missed on the first world. The minions they commanded could indeed create, but now they also had something to destroy. When left unchecked, their minions would resume waring, undoing all that had been brought into existence. Before they could rectify the problem, the second world was rendered inert, covered completely in a pale blue sheet of ice.

With lessons learned, the Elemental Lord's third attempt was the grandest design of all, using their divine powers directly in the world's creation. Abysil filled it with rivers, lakes, and oceans. Tecton ensured the ground was deep and strong. Nimbor blew clouds into the sky and winds down over the land. And Ryolith, for the first and only time in its life, opened its great maw and let forth a ball of white-hot flame to forever light to world. At last, their efforts were a success - their grand design was stable. This final world was perfect in its imperfections, vast in its detail, and complete in the promise it held for what it might become. The two barren worlds were left as they were, to provide an eternal warning of the perils of unchecked power. They would later be named as the moons Lunaxa and Lunina.

### The Elemental Planes

In order to protect the world from their chaotic minions, the Elemental Lords sought to contain their elemental power and keep it from spoiling their creation. It would not be enough to simply remain vigil or lock themselves away in a realm of their own, for the destructive nature of their minions could easily be great enough to spill over into the new-born world. Therefore, each lord would have to take themselves and their minions into separate domains, where they could maintain an eternal vigil without distraction or temptation. Though they were loath to confine themselves to solitude, they knew it was the only way to ensure the world could flourish. Besides, though isolated they would be, it was doubtful that their minions would not try to find ways to escape. Being the jailers of such chaotic beings was sure to keep them busy.

Nimbor took to the skies and established a domain above even the highest clouds, whilst Abysil flowed down into the deepest aquifers and ocean basins. Tecton moved to inhabit the lowest caves and caverns, whilst Ryolith made for the molten centre of the world. Each Elemental Plane became suffused with the purest form of each lord's power, roiling and raging with the barely contained energies of the elemental minions.

### The Guardians

Safe though this budding new world was, the Elemental Lords did not leave their creation unguarded. Before their departure, they designed creatures that would watch over the world in their absence. Each was imparted with a portion of their power, becoming elemental demigods. Ryolith created the Dragons - noble, winged beasts that could breath fire. Nimbor left the Banshees to watch over the skies and high places. Tecton raised the Stone Titans who would sleep deep within mountains, and rise to roam about the land when needed. Abysil created the Sirens to patrol from shallow rivers to the crushing ocean depths. Each of these would watch over and care for the portion of natural order governed by the laws of their lord.

But, who would care for the life that was, slowly but surely, spreading tentatively across the face of this new world? The Lords, in their wisdom, decided that if their combined powers created life, then the final guardians should also be made through collaboration. The four came together and created the paired Bovine and Herdeer. Whilst the other guardians were immortal, the nature guardians were destined to be born, live, mate, and die as all other mortals did.

With the creation of the guardians, the Elemental Lords could maintain the isolation without fear - knowing that the world would be well tended to.

## 2nd Age - The Tranquillity Era

### Life Flourishes

For an unknowable length of time, life on the Known World prospered. From the first, ancient stirrings, all manner of creatures evolved. Small plants took root, growing into trees and eventually forests. Empty oceans filled with corals, fish, and marine reptiles and mammals. Birds filled the skies above, and insects and fungi the caves below. At some place and time, a primitive form of hominid appeared and expanded across the world, evolving into many of the prime species that exist today.

During this time, there were no natural disasters. No earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, no floods or famines. The Elemental Lords were keeping their minions in check, and the guardians were keeping their sworn vigil over the world. So, for aeons, life was allowed to grow in harmony. What struggles did exist were of a purely natural kind - of predators and prey, of birth and death.

### A Divine Gift

The ripening world, so full of beauty and wonder, attracted the attention of the Immortals of the Plane of Undying. Their hearts filled with joy, seeing the pure good that the Elemental Lords had created in their exile. But how were they to reward such an accomplishment? The lords banishment had been absolute, and they had to remain in the elemental planes to keep control of their minions. So, the Immortals sought instead to reward the children of the elements. They would bestow a gift on life itself.

During a mortal creature's life, their soul fills with life energy. Every experience and dream, every encounter with another life. All the songs and sounds, the sights and smells. A catalogue of moments and memory that defines one's life until, upon a creature's death, it is released from their corporeal form as a spirit. The Immortal's gift to the world was to permit the souls of mortals to travel to the Plane of Undying, where they can live forever.

### The Coming Doom

Unbeknownst to the Immortals, this gift was to have dark ramifications for the Known World. For between the Plane of Undying and the Mortal Plane lies a realm between realms - a dark, seething nether of immaterial chaos. This void is home to great malignant entities known as the Harbingers, who embody aspects of evil and sin. It is not known how they came into being. Some believe they may also have been outcasts of the Immortal Plane, whilst others hold that they are the manifestations of the sins of mortals. Whatever their origin, it is clear that they despise the creations of mortals and immortals.

The souls of mortals, now able to travel to the Plane of Undying through this void, were as beacons to the Harbingers. They were drawn to the life essence like moths to a flame, and they began to feed on whatever souls they could ensnare - immediately developing an insatiable hunger for the spirits of mortals. However, they found that not all souls are equal. Those of the prime species grow brighter and stronger than other creatures, and the bovine and herdeer even more so. Each soul gave the Harbingers power, and with this power came aspirations to assault the Plane of Undying. However, the natural trickle of souls would not be enough to allow them to mount such a siege. So, they instead focussed their efforts on harvesting more souls. To that end, they set about creating legions of demons with which to invade the material realm of mortals and enslave the Known World for reaping.

## 3rd Age - The Turmoil Era (ToDo)

### The Demonic War

On the continent that would one day be called Elencern, a lush woodland peninsula in the far south was suddenly thrown into turmoil. A hole was torn in the fabric of reality, and legions of demons and nether spawn were released into our world. Beasts were slaughtered for sport, and sentient mortals were butchered in droves. The chaos was such that the Elemental Lords awoke from their slumber, and felt they could no longer leave nature to fend for itself. They desperately tried to slow the tide of demons. The ground cracked in great fissures, fire erupted from the mountains, and colossal waves were driven inland by ferocious storms. The world was like a body fighting a disease. But it was not enough. The demigods joined the fight, holding back the armies of the Nether long enough for mortals to flee north. But ground was lost with every battle. Immortal creatures that had lived for countless lifetimes were snuffed from existence in a cruel and thoughtless war. But it was not enough. The elements could cut off advances and force demons into bottlenecks, and the demigods could give their lives to save mortals. But the demons had numbers on their side. And for every soul slain, more demons filled the ranks of the enemy. What the mortal realm needed was more soldiers to fight back. But even the sentient races were still too primitive to put up any resistance.  In desperation, the Elemental Lords had only one choice - a decision that would forever change the Mortal Plane. They combined their power, and in a mighty eruption that shattered an entire island, they released magic into the world. Mana shot high and enveloped the skies - forming the stars of the Constellation Arcana. A great rain of fiery rock descended from the heavens down onto the land. Great meteorites and geodes crashed all around, embuing sites across the Known World with power. This mana gifted the prime races magical abilities and allowing them to finally join the fight and assist the demigods in driving back the great enemy. Magic manifested in many ways. Heightened intelligence lead to technological improvements: metallurgy, agriculture, and medicine appeared simultaneously across the Known World. Some mortals were able to wield the power of the elements themselves, whilst others gained incredible arcane abilities. The appearance of healing magics and soul warding also began to starve the demons of their reinforcements. Life was able to once again endure for prolonged periods, allowing cultures to bloom. For some humanoids and beasts, their infusion with magic was so complete that their powers eclipsed all others, even the demigod guardian races. These new gods and saints were immortal unless slain and they soon became known far and wide as champions, patrons, and protectors. Though the scales were starting to tip, decades or perhaps even centuries of warfare were still to come. Budding civilisations rose, only to fall again when they became too populous. Some would disappear almost overnight, whilst others would leave fragmented histories and mythology behind. Perhaps the demons were pruning rising powers in targeted strikes or rising from within societies that grew careless with the souls of their dead. However, slowly but surely this once unstoppable foe was driven back to the lands from which it had first appeared - now called the Great Wastes. This land had felt such unworldly unrest that reality itself had been distorted and altered. Mortals and demigods alike who entered were driven insane by the horrors they witnessed, and survivors who made it back were tormented with waking nightmares for the rest of their days. Daring to go no further, a great fortress citadel was constructed on the borders of the Wastes, to prevent demons from returning.  

### Peace without peace.

Despite this great victory, the world was forever changed. Drained of much of their powers, the Elemental Lords were no longer able to hold complete control over their minions. Even peaceful lands untouched by conflict were soon affected by extreme weather and restless seas. Mountain belts creaked and groaned, and entire forests were burnt away by drought and fire. A few demons lingered on, slipping into the wilderness to corrupt nature, or disguise themselves amongst mortal populations - working their dark influence for centuries to come. The release of magic also had profound side effects on some of the demigod races, mutating them and causing many to become violent towards those they were sworn to protect.  
A great number of the saints and gods that had arisen in the war had laid down their lives in the defence of mortals. Despite their deaths, some of the most well-known gods have lingered on - sometimes even until the present day - through the magic of belief. These patron gods and saints continue to exist as spiritual avatars which, though not as powerful as they were in life, can continue to guide and protect the people who believe in them. Only a scant few gods and saints survived the war, and whilst most continue to be beacons of divinity, some became corrupted by their power. During the war, dragons passed on their knowledge of magic to a group of early [[Human|humans]] that became known as the Dragonhearth clan. They taught control and restraint, before hiding themselves away in the farthest corners of the land. And so it was that protection of this world was passed onto mortals.

## 4th Age - The Revival Era

### Dawn of Civilisation

By the beginning of the 4th Age, the prime races had spread to every corner of the Known World in the pursuit of peaceful lands. Now, with the threat of demons all but gone, civilisations were allowed to grow and prosper. Technology advanced quickly, as those gifted with arcane magic now had more time to engage in scholarly pursuits. Increasing populations lead to expansion and soon disparate cultures came into contact with one another. Gradually, the maps of the modern world began to take shape as borders were established, trade deals negotiated, and pacts formed and broken. The time had finally come for mortals to shape the world.  

## 5th Age - The Discovery Era

### An Age of Heroes

Following the turmoil of the last few years, armies and navies now lie in ruins. Many heroes and indeed villains have been born from the fires of war. Some become adventurers, who seek to find riches and glory from amongst the ashes of the past. Instead of nations, it is these intrepid individuals who will shape the world going forward. In light of increasing industrialisation, a new demonic assault, and the prevalence of adventurers dictating world events, mages and scholars announce that the 5th Age has begun.
