Seven demon lords that plan to bring about a new age of ruination upon the Known World. Their machinations are far-reaching and their plan is perpetually in motion. Over the last century, their schemes have had seemingly unrelated impacts, with some events being more subtle and others more overt. The fruits of their labour are varied in both scale, form, and success. The full scale of this conspiracy is appreciated by a vanishingly small number of disparate mortals. At the dawn of the 5th Age, the Harbingers collectively sense the time to complete their grand scheme was at hand.

Ultimately, their primary goal failed. However, the wound inflicted on the world was still powerful enough to create a new rift in the material plane - known thereafter as the Needles.
