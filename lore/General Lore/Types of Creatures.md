## Mortals
#### Beasts
Normal animals. The Known World contains a myriad selection of creatures from across the history of the real world. Mammals are dominant in Norcernwere whilst reptiles are dominant in Elencern. Quintessa is primarily large insects, though also has a high concentration of Aberrant and Abomination creatures. 
#### Magical Beasts
Normal animals that have been partially empowered by arcane mana. They are usually larger than their kin and often establish themselves as the dominant member of their collective group or territory. It is these magical beasts that are involved in [[Beastwalkers|beastwalker]] rituals.
#### Aberrants
Animal-like creatures with arcane mutations. These creatures tend to appear near mana hotspots and display heightened intelligence - with some even being able to create basic tools and weapons, or even simple languages or mimicry. Some even become intelligent enough to be on par with members of the Prime Species. It is theorised that the hominid prime species of the Known World all evolved from a common aberrant ancestor.

**Notable Examples:**
- Unknown early hominid from which the humanoid prime species evolved
- Beringcia - gorilla-leopard hybrid that live in mountainous regions
- Amphibian Folk - live in Silverleaf Forest - at war with the rat folk
- Rat Folk - live in Silverleaf Forest - at war with the amphibian folk
- Ruffilians - feathered lemurs that live in the Overgrowth
- Swinious - proto-[[bortusken]] that still exist today in the Savage Hills
- Serefawn - small deer with deciduous tree antlers that live in the Verdant Glades
#### Prime Species
The most intelligent species in the Known World. In order to be considered a part of this category, a species must have established at least one stable civilisation with a rich culture. 

**Current list of Prime Species:**
- [[Human|Humans]]
- [[Neandal|Neandals]]
- [[Kal Krom]]
- [[Bortusken]]
- [[Olmetek]]
- [[Antanai]]
#### Abominations
Creatures who have been possessed by demons that have become trapped in the Mortal Plane. These creatures have been known to multiply if left unchecked. 

**Notable Examples:**
- The Cephalon Beast - giant squid-like monstrosity
- Komeklion - humanoid lizards
## Demigods / Guardians
The species created by the Elemental Lords and charged with caretaking the Known World after the elements were locked away in their own planes. Most of the demigod species are immortal unless slain, and each were the protectors of their respective domain in the early world. However, they became mutated when magic was released, with some even becoming hostile and violent towards mortals. 
#### Dragons
Wise and noble, dragons are some of the most powerful creatures known. Gargantuan winged reptiles with four legs and the ability to breathe fire. In old age, the dragons could consume themselves in flame and be born anew from the ashes. When magic was released and began to empower mortals, the dragons were the first to fully understand the dangers of this new power. They taught the early mages restraint and cautioned them of the destruction the unchecked magic could cause.

**Wyverns** 
Dragons mutated the ability to lay eggs. Wyverns soon hatched from these clutches, smaller and leaner than their parents and with only their hind legs and wings. The wyverns were also completely bestial, quickly becoming apex predators wherever they went and devastating ecosystems. Many dragons took to killing their own offspring - a process that often drove them to madness. Due to their status as magical beasts, wyverns are often seen as the ultimate form that can be acquired by a [[Beastwalkers|beastwalker]]. 
#### Stone Titans
The stone titans are recorded as appearing vaguely humanoid, though they are said to have been 50 feet tall and made of sentient rock. Evidence has recently emerged that they helped establish early civilisations where they would cohabit with mortals. These cities predate all others, and it appears as though they were supreme engineers and architects - carving elaborate dwellings deep beneath the earth. 

**Giants**
Given the immaturity of studies into the stone titans, several theories exist around the creation of the stone giants. During the First Demonic War, likely around the advent of magic, it has been speculated that the stone titans became increasingly tyrannical. Alternatively, they may have done so earlier, as they were worshipped by their mortal subjects as gods. However, another theory assumes that instead, they were motivated by the need to protect their civilisations - and perhaps mortals - from the endless waves of demonic assaults on the world. In all cases, their hubris or desperation led them in pursuit of engineering life itself. However, it is clear that they were exploiting mortals to help gather resources and construct their experiments. Eventually, either through some catastrophic failure or divine intervention, all of the stone titans and giants were stripped of life - frozen in place for all time. This event seems to coincide with a great calamity that sunk a large portion of land in the area today known as the Stormy Coast. 
#### Sea Witches
Very little is known about the sea witches. Recovered ancient drawings show them as ammonite or nautilus headed creatures with elongated, tentacled bodies. Some modern sailors hold to superstitions that the sea witches magically lure ships into dangerous waters, or tell stories of giant tentacled creatures attacking ships that stray too far from the coastline. 
#### Banshees
Basically nothing is known about the banshees save for their name. There are no consistent accounts of their appearance or where they dwelt. Some speculate from this that they were shapeshifters, whilst others posit that they went extinct long before recorded history began.
#### Herdeer and Bovine
Formerly the joint guardians of nature. Unlike the other demigods the herdeer and bovine, though long-lived, are not immortal. Instead, they are born, grow up, mate, and die - just like the mortal creatures they watch over. Thanks to their humanoid arms, they are able to make and wear clothing and wield simple tools and weapons. Though the herdeer only show minor physical mutation as a result of magic, the bovine's temperament became universally bloodthirsty and savage. As a result, the two are now incompatible with each other, and the continued existence of both the herdeer and bovine is maintained nonconsensually. 

**Herdeer** 
All female centaur-like creatures with the lower body and head of a Cervidae and the torso and arms of a humanoid. They are generally compassionate, peaceful, and kind. The herdeer tend to live in small groups, caretaking over an area of wilderness. Over time, their bodies have physically mutated to take on the traits of the region they live in (e.g. the herdeer of Silverlead Forest have bioluminescent spots and extra large antlers). They are also gifted at arcane nature magic. 

**Bovine**
All male centaur-like creatures with the lower body and head of a Bovidae and the torso and arms of a humanoid. They were previously stoic and hardy, if a little short tempered. Now, they are aggressive, war-like, and cruel. Bovine generally group together to form warbands that raid mortal settlements and convoys. They are still herbivorous, so bloodletting for them is purely for sport. They have been known to take slaves, particularly from herdeer populations. 
## Elementals
#### Minions
Powerful, chaotic manifestations of elemental energy. When they appear they cause destruction and unbalance the natural order and processes of the area - although they also tend to materialise where there is already elemental upheaval and unrest. They are often associated with natural disasters such as floods, forest fires, landslides, and storms. 
#### Sprites
Joyful, positive manifestations of elemental energy that appear as small creatures. When tamed, they form extremely strong emotional bonds with their companion.  
## Gods / Saints
Mortals who have been so heavily imbued with magical power that they have ascended to godhood and become immortal through the power of collective belief. 

**Notable Examples:**
- The Dreamer - a large cave bear near Folkesund.
- Go√ümut - goat god of hills and cliffs - was sacrificed by bovine.
- Mak Tar - patron panther god of the Tar Tribe of [[olmetek]].
- The Saints Eternal - three supremely powerful apothecaries that sometimes appear in times of war or disaster as gleaming armoured battle healers.
## Demons
Creatures from the void that seek to spread chaos and destruction. To enter the material plane, they must first consume the unprotected souls of dead mortals. Demons come in a myriad of shapes and sizes, and each may hold allegiance to one or many of [[The Seven Harbingers]].
#### Lesser Demons
Demons formed by the consumption of a single soul. 

**Notable Examples:**
- Imps - small, skittering, red skinned demons that work in swarms. Whilst dangerous, they mostly seek to sew chaos.
- Shattered - possessed corpses that have been hideously altered and reformed into deadly ambushers - usually found in cold climates where the bodies do not readily decompose.
- Deathgaze Priests - lesser demon lieutenants that can project a debilitating aura and can render mortals unconscious with a single glance.
- Flayers - warrior demons devoted to the Harbinger Ragellus. They wield deadly weapons and often form the primary foot soldier ranks of demonic armies. 
- Incubi and Succubi - demons devoted to the Harbinger Nuxille that seduce mortals so that their souls can be possessed.
#### Greater Demons
Demons formed by the consumption of multiple souls. 

**Notable Examples:**
- Besiegers - living artillery platforms that hurl hellfire, corrosive bile, or pestilent fog projectiles from their gaping jaws.
- Infernal Constructs - mechanical monstrosities created in the material plane and then animated by a greater demon.
#### The Harbingers
The commanders of the demonic hordes. Each represents negative, destructive, or otherwise sinful domains, and so their names have become curse words in the Known World. 
- Belphegor the Blight - represents rot, rust, and decay
- Putrillus the Pestilent - represents sickness and disease
- Nuxille the Covetous - represents lust and desire
- Ragellus the Incensed - represents anger and bloodlust
- Anxelli the Vexation - represents struggle and strife
- Marquess the Avarice - represents greed and selfishness
- Nexus the Enigmatic - represents the unknown and unfathomable
#### Ascendants
Mortals who have aligned themselves with demons and show enough devotion or potential to be gifted demonic powers. They are the dark equivalent to saints. 
## Undead
Mortal creatures afflicted with the Plague of Undying. When a creature expires from this contagion, their soul remains trapped in their body through necromantic magic. However, any memories or free will is lost, and these creatures either revert to the most basic of instincts, or become thralls to those capable of controlling them through necromancy. The bodies of plague slain continue to rot, albeit at a slower rate than normal. This makes them even more dangerous, as they can continue to spread pestilence and taint long after they are turned. Even when all the flesh, muscles, and connective tissue has decomposed, their skeletons can still remain animated. Undead can only be put down if the body is utterly destroyed or the soul is released by holy magic.

**Dark Rangers**
During the defence of the Wold and the surrounding provinces, many soldiers fell to the Plague of Undying. However, there are a scattered few who were either too stubborn to die, or who possessed some kind of unknown magical protection. Whatever the case, these plague cursed individuals, though not completely immune to the effects of this contagion, were able to survive in a kind of limbo between life and death. Unable to return to society, they have instead sworn oaths to patrol the Deadwold and its borders. Their connection to the necromantic plague allows them to track down concentrations of plague slain, which they then thin down or redirect away from troubling the outside world. But their most favoured quarry are the necromancers and plague priests, which they hunt with a relentlessness and determination that can only be the product of a lust for vengeance. 
## Null Warriors
Mysterious armoured entities that seem to originate from the void but are not in league with demons. They are nonetheless hostile to all creatures and usually appear at sites of powerful magic that they will attempt to guard - though for what purpose remains a mystery. They do not seem to make any vocal noises, nor do they appear to breathe. Attempts to communicate, including via telepathically, are ineffective - as if the armour is hollow and merely being animated. Emerging from shadowy clouds of nothingness, their form is of a large, fully plated, humanoid warrior and they wield huge and cruel-looking weapons. Their equipment is made from an oily-looking, iridescent metal that is highly resistant to damage. However, attacks to what few gaps and joints exist in their armour do prove effective. When slain, whatever is inside or animating the armour vanishes, with some inky black smoke leaking from their armour plates as they fall to the ground. The metal of their weapons and armour immediately turns a matt grey iron colour, and rapidly rusts and breaks down as if being attacked by strong acid. Within minutes, all trace of their existence is gone and, unlike demons, they do not leave scars in the fabric of the material plane.
