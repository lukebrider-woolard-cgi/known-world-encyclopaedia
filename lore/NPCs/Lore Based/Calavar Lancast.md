The Mage King of the Northern Kingdom. A powerful [[Mages|Mage]] whose rule resulted in a civil war. He was eventually overthrown and killed by a rebel faction lead by his brother, [[Gren Lancast]].

Initially motivated by the recent emergence of the [[Bortusken]] and [[Engineers]], as he saw the new technologies they were creating as a threat to mages. He believed that if these inventions were controlled by mages then this would maintain the status quo - keeping mages as the chiefs of science and innovation. This stepped on a lot of toes, as engineered inventions were seen as a means for non-magical individuals to achieve wonderous feats. To keep people in line, the Inquisition was formed, to act as a secret police under the direct control of the king.
Twynburh began rapid expansion and industrialisation, all carefully orchestrated by the king. However, he soon started to run into issues - this industrialisation required resources that were hard to come by or needed in higher quantities than were normally available. He also began to worry that other mages were rapidly gaining power.
The demand for resources placed a strain on the provinces of the Northern Kingdom that would eventually reach boiling point. It also resulted in an invasion of the northern shores of the Razorvine Jungle. 
When the war started, many mages sided with the king - keen to keep their new elevated powers and extend them further. Some even gained positions of authority. This worked for the king at first, but it continued to feed his paranoia. Eventually, he trusted only the mages of his inquisition and royal guard, and began to alienate the others.
