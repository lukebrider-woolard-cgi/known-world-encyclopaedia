## Dissolution of the Northern Kingdom
[[Inquisitor Alabastia]] has been working in the government of the Northern Kingdom in secret, and is also controlling the [[Order of the Iron Rose]] from the shadows. The Iron Rose have been taking key forts around Greenhart in preparation. The sky pirates' attacks on the [[kal krom]] causes an uprising that results in a battle near Avonhead. King Gren is killed in the battle, possibly murdered by spies. It is rumoured that he saw a rusting rose before the battle. The King's death causes a succession crisis. Alabastia, under the guise of Saint Ethyran, ends the power vacuum and unrest by pushing the High Lords of Twynburh to assume control of the Kingdom. This unrest means that the capital is unable to assist the other regions. Coupled with the lack of a ruling monarch leads to many of the provincial High Lords feeling no further allegiance to the Northern Kingdom. All part of the [[Order of the Iron Rose]]'s plan - the provinces secede, and the Northern Kingdom reverts to the country of Greenhart.
