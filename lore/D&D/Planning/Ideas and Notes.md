## Darrius and the Rogues
An adventuring group including Darrius Silversong, Ga Nuna, Tutel, and Amalie. They have been hired by Shanair Avento as the competitive rivals to the main party who were hired by Dormain Avento. Both groups are to send the Aventos interesting items from Quintessa as part of a competition between the two Thieves Guild leaders.
## Elements fallen from grace in Quintessa
An outcast group of [[antanai]] still revere the elements, but the majority of their civilisation has become enamoured with arcane magic - and [[Demon Hunters|warlock]] magic in some cases. High Haven now acts as a beacon of elemental power, and this may call to [[Mela Uak]]. However, the area is under threat from one of the sorcerers three (Lester Bell) and a separate incursion by spies from the rest of the antanai. 
## Ballthasar has taken over a fortress in the Holds of Vultash
His work in releasing Belphegor the Blight was rewarded by ascension to godhood. He has taken a fortress in the Holds of Vultash as his home, and is extending his influence over the undead of the Known World. This includes the Ruins of Djurnoth, where he is trying to create another hub of undead. Involve lots of Dex saves for slipperiness. 
## Dissolution of the Northern Kingdom
Inquisitor Alabastia has been controlling the government of the Northern Kingdom and the Order of the Iron Rose from the shadows. The Iron Rose have been taking key forts around Greenhart in preparation. The sky pirates' attacks on the [[kal krom]] causes an uprising that results in a battle near Avonhead. King Gren is killed in the battle, likely murdered by spies. Alabastia, under the guise of Saint Ethyran, uses the power vacuum and unrest to push the Lords into agreeing to split the provinces of the Kingdom - as the country is sick of trying to make things work. 
## The Sorcerers Three and the Old Gods
Three powerful sorcerers are travelling the world, seeking to claim the power of gods for themselves. They visit individuals and settlements with strong ties to old gods and, through manipulation and murder, steal the magics of the gods. Sorcerer's use Abjurer, Evoker, and Gloom Weaver, with power to potentially turn adventurer's magic against them. One ~~is~~ was in High Haven, and the other two are in Silverleaf Forest investigating the amphibian and rat folk cultures.
