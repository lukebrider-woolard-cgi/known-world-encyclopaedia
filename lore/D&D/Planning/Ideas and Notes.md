## Dissolution of the Northern Kingdom
[[Inquisitor Alabastia]] has been working in the government of the Northern Kingdom in secret, and is also controlling the [[Order of the Iron Rose]] from the shadows. The Iron Rose have been taking key forts around Greenhart in preparation. The sky pirates' attacks on the [[kal krom]] causes an uprising that results in a battle near Avonhead. King Gren is killed in the battle, possibly murdered by spies. It is rumoured that he saw a rusting rose before the battle. The King's death causes a succession crisis. Alabastia, under the guise of **Saint Ethyran**, ends the power vacuum and unrest by pushing the High Lords of Twynburh to assume control of the Kingdom. The lack of a ruling monarch and reduction in support for the frontier provinces leads to many of the provincial High Lords feeling no further allegiance to the Northern Kingdom. All part of the [[Order of the Iron Rose]]'s plan - the provinces secede, and the Northern Kingdom reverts to the country of Greenhart. From here, Alabastia plans to continue her former King's goal of an industrialised nation of progress. Instead of forcing this on the world, Greenhart will lead by example.  
## The Sorcerers Three and the Old Gods

One ~~is~~ was in High Haven, and the other two are in Silverleaf Forest investigating the amphibian and rat folk cultures.
## Ballthasar has taken over a fortress in the Holds of Vultash
His work in releasing Belphegor the Blight was rewarded by ascension to godhood. He has taken a fortress in the Holds of Vultash as his home, and is extending his influence over the undead of the Known World.

## Terracotta City Commission First Ironclad
Blueprints for the world's first ironclad naval ship are drawn up by engineers in Terracotta City whilst the Northern Kingdom' expansionism was threatening to stretch to Elencern. However, construction never commenced, as no single Trade Baron could afford such a weapon. The project was shelved when the civil war in the Northern Kingdom escalated. In the 5th Age, the Trade Barons of Terracotta City eventually agree to jointly finance the project, with the plan that the ship can patrol their territorial waters and keep their merchant ships safe. Just before its completion, one family takes the ship for their own in a major power play.
