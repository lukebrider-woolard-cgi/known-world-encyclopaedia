#### Background

	- exploration recall and survivalist
#### Backstory Notes
- Saved by the main party - taken to safety by [[Ephemeridae Bellflower|Ephemeridae]]
- Trained as a [[Mages|witch]] by Clebekah
- Died and was resurrected by Goßmut (goat god of hills and cliffs)
- Magic of the avatar of Goßmut lives inside her
#### Current Story Notes
- _The Mad Goat's Revenge_ - to follow Gossmut's words, Brie will make it her duty to kill or destroy any demon or demonically influenced being, the most important being the Bovine that tortured Gossmut and killed both him and her family. 
- _Shadows of Purpose_ - apart from brief and fairly chaotic moments spent with Clebekah, Brie has really been formally trained in anything. Her goal is to learn a skill or a useful talent from someone. My thoughts would be a) potion/poison making from [[Lydia]], b) some learnt arcane skill from either [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] or someone in the Starlight tower, or c) knowledge for demon slaying from [[Sir Kane Kellester|Sir Kane]] or his order. 
- _Guardian's Reunion_ Brie would like to see [[Ephemeridae Bellflower|Ephe]] again, to show her how far she has come and how strong she has become. This might be more of a tricky one, so potentially in need of DM assistance to see how my ex-character would react to where Brie is now (guilt, pride, fear?). 
- _Teeth Queen_ As well as making a friendship bracelet for everyone in the party (only Risely is without one), Brie is looking to create a whole outfit adorned with the teeth of monsters and beasts that she and her friends have slain. I'm thinking necklace, ear-rings, studded in her belt, you name it. Everyone's gotta to have a hobby, right?
