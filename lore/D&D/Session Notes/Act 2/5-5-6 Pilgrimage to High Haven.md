## Elements fallen from grace in Quintessa
An outcast group of [[antanai]] still revere the elements, but the majority of their civilisation has become enamoured with arcane magic - and [[Demon Hunters|warlock]] magic in some cases. High Haven now acts as a beacon of elemental power, and this calls to [[Mela Uak]]. However, the area is under threat from one of the sorcerers three (Lester Bell) and a separate incursion by spies from the the greater Antanai civilisation.
