### Old Prose
Approximately two weeks after the museum heist, ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿, and ﻿Mela'uak﻿ found themselves together in the safe room under the city. They discussed their recent endeavours and collectively agreed that: they were all tired of being couped up, they find ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ disturbing, and they were sick of smelling like a sewer.

After taking several underground passageways, the trio surfaced in the ﻿Artisan's District﻿ and headed straight to the public bathhouse. There they soaked in the heated baths and discussed matters some more. At one point the conversation turned to their prior experiences in the city, and ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿' revealed that he grew up in the ﻿Merchant's Quarter﻿. He suspected that his father and brother still worked there, selling fine carpets from a store in the indoor market.

﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ then explained that he had received word from a high-ranking member of the thieves guild (a 'boarish' individual named ﻿Dormian﻿ , who was a close personal friend if ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ was to be believed). He had been instructed to bring the items they had 'recovered' from the museum immediately. ﻿Mela'uak﻿ and ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ wished to tag along.

After a brief stop at the Fishbones, the three headed back down into the sewers, this time taking a route much deeper than they had been before. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ claimed with much bravado that he knew exactly where he was going, but ﻿Mela'uak﻿ chose to trust in the various cryptic runes - that only he seemed to understand - which were posted at several junctions.

Passing through a seemingly abandoned underground market, the group were suddenly ambushed by a large band of cloaked figures, who descended silently from the shadows and viciously attacked ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ with poisoned blades. He attempted to scare them away but quickly succumbed to the poison. Springing into action, ﻿Mela'uak﻿ put himself in harm's way to cover the now unconscious bortusken, slaying some of the wretched sewer dwellers. [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] was then able to destroy the remainder with precise applications of arcane magic. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ was near death, but the timely application of some first aid removed the worst of the poison, and ﻿Mela'uak﻿ sacrificed a healing potion to restore the [[Mages|bard]] to better health. For ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, this was the first time he had ever felt that someone had his back and cared about his wellbeing. To say that the experience moved him would be an understatement. ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ inspected the bodies of the shadowy figures and guessed that they might be members of the [[Cult of the Eternal Night]] - doomsayers who believe the end of the world is approaching.

After this ordeal, the trio was able to locate a guild meeting point a short distance away in a large cistern containing around a dozen members all going about various dealings. They were called upon - by name - by ﻿Dormian﻿. He congratulated them on their work at the museum, implying that the use of demons was an inspired way to throw off any scent of guild involvement (the party chose not to correct the record). He collected the ruby necklace and brass amulet from ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, and then instructed each party member to name a reward they deemed appropriate.

﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ asked for gold and that he be kept in mind for future guild activity - such as the planned heist of arcoal (the fuel for skyships) that he had heard about. He received a large sack of coins and ﻿Dormian﻿ made a note in his pocketbook. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ was also patched up by a guild [[Mages|mage]], who fully cured him of his poison.

﻿Mela'uak﻿ requested that the guild provide any information on the former Captain that he was searching for - the man who ransacked his village and stole the spear from his people. Again, ﻿Dormian﻿ made a note in his book and promised to pass on information if it became available.

﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ inquired as to whether his help recovering the items from the museum would square the debt he owed the guild. He also asked that the guild compensate the family of the scribe who was killed during the heist and requested any information that the guild had on his former master - [[Inquisitor Alabastia]]. ﻿Dormian﻿ confirmed that his debt was paid, though made a point of telling [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] that his skills as a telepath made him valuable, and so the guild would happily work with him again in the future. He made more notes in his leather book and intimated that the Avento family would see to it that the scribe's family received a charitable donation to help with their tragic loss. He finally agreed to a similar bargain to the one he had offered ﻿Mela'uak﻿ - that any information gathered would be passed on as requested.

Finally, [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] warned of the nearby presence of the Cult, to which ﻿Dormian﻿ was seemingly unaware.

With all that squared away, the group headed up a nearby access point and out into the evening air of the city above. They found their way to a fancy inn called the Sage & Flagon, just opposite the central park in the ﻿Artisan's District﻿. There they finally enjoyed a round purchased by ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, and [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] telepathically invited ﻿Arbor﻿ to join them if he was free. He also sent his familiar Carrion, to find ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ and peck him until he came to the inn to join them.
