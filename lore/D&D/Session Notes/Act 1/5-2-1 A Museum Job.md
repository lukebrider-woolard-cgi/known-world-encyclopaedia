### Old Prose
Realising that this bortusken was the contact Mela’uak needed to see, they waited for his set to finish before attempting to make their enquiries. After a brief misunderstanding, they went into a back room to plot in private. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ introduced himself and ﻿Mela'uak﻿ explained that he had found a spear belonging to his people on display in the museum of antiquities - he wants to ‘recover’ it and figured the best way is to employ the help of the thieves guild.

﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ explained he has a smaller job that the party can help with in order to test their skills - acquire a gold and ruby necklace from a nearby pawn shop. Though he remained quiet on the matter, ﻿Arbor﻿ recognised this necklace as it belonged to the Cyricus family (his adoptive parents).

The party headed to Vinto’s Vintages - a grimy and cluttered pawn shop in Saltash. Vinto knows [[Thrakor]], he also won’t reveal the names of people he buys from, and he wanted 5000 gold for the necklace. ﻿Mela'uak﻿, ﻿Arbor﻿, and ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ turned invisible and entered the back of the store to try and find the necklace. ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ managed to steal some art pieces from the store. After some discussion, ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ used his arcane abilities to 'convince' Vinto to give up the necklace for only 50 gold. However, on the way back to the fishbones the still invisible ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ picked ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿' pocket for fun and took the necklace - causing a brief fight with ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ in the tavern.

Though ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ now had his prize he was being exceedingly tight-lipped about who in the guild wanted the necklace, and ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ threatened to use his powers to find out the truth. The party are starting to realise ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ either is or was an Inquisitor.

Now that ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ felt they were ready the party came up with a plan: they would go out and get some equipment (thieves tools and a disguise kit) from a back-alley vendor, and then separately head to the ﻿Guild's District﻿ and approach the museum's southern wing. From there they would break in either under invisibility or disguised as scribes (who are known to patrol the museum at night).

﻿Mela'uak﻿ used his new set of thieves tools to break into a window on the botanical wing of the museum. It was pitch dark so ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ and ﻿Arbor﻿ lit torches and lead the way in their disguises. Once on the far side of the exhibits of trees, plants, and small animals, the group headed through a door into another wing of the museum. The invisible ﻿Mela'uak﻿ indicated that this was where his people's spear was to be found. The party accidentally activated some form of arcane trap but managed to resist its effects.

After removing the spear from its display case the party heard and saw two young scribes patrolling towards them. As they went to leave the way they came, ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ suddenly headed into the middle of the cultural artefacts chamber to look for an amulet. Unfortunately, before the party could make good their escape, the scribes detected the triggered trap and sounded the alarm. Claxons blared, and magical shields enclosed the exterior windows and doors of the museum.

The party were attacked by several animated exhibits that came to life during the alarm. One of the scribes was enchanted to go and turn the alarm off, whilst the other one remained in the chamber believing there were two other scribes present (﻿Arbor﻿ and ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿). The young boy hid behind an information desk whilst the party attempted to fight off the traps. Above the far door behind the scribe's hiding place, a suit of arcane armour began to initiate, with ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ warning the party that such a contraption was beyond their skills to defeat in combat. Meanwhile, ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ stuck to the shadows and continued to steal things. Unexpectedly the struggle took a darker turn as the air turned cold and several small yet horrific demons materialised inside the information desk. Whilst ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ struggled to wrestle an animated suit of armour on a patch of grease, the others attempted to help the scribe and ﻿Arbor﻿ who had become surrounded by the hellish chicken-like fiends. An expert bolt of arcane magic from ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ sent the creatures back to the void, but not before they had mauled the young scribe to death.

Just as the arcane armour was beginning to rip free of its mount above the doorway, the alarms suddenly stopped - no doubt silenced by the enchanted scribe. The giant guardian slowly returned itself to idle, and the animated armour that had been bludgeoning ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ attempted to return to its plinth - though kept slipping over in the grease.

Collectively agreeing to leave before more scribes could show up, the party retreated back the way they had come, with [[Thrakor]] pocketing the bronze bovine amulet he had been seeking.

Once outside in the cool night air, triumphant but bruised, the party quickly headed for a nearby sewer access down by the canals. As they unlocked the door, ﻿Mela'uak﻿ was suddenly struck down by a hooded figure who snatched the spear from his hands. But the figure stopped in its tracks when it recognised the olmetek and spoke a name - Arak'tar. ﻿Mela'uak﻿ instantly recognised his brother - Ohtli. He had travelled from across the sea in search of his tribe's ancestral weapon - after it was stolen by invaders from the Northern Kingdom. Without it, the tribe has fallen into ruin, having lost their lands to opportunists. He also explained that there is a prophecy: if the spear is returned, the one who wields it will help the tribe restore their lands and honour.

The party and Ohtli headed underground and [[Thrakor]] guided them down several stairs and ladders, and through several damp passages until they came to a small and unassuming room. Inside they found a well-stocked and provisioned hideout - one of the many guild saferooms in which to lay low. Once there, the party discussed some difficult matters. ﻿Mela'uak﻿ revealed that he is not an olmetek emissary, but was instead cast out and cursed from his former tribe. He had heard about the spear and was also on the lookout for a man he believed stole it - Captain Claggar Pertovich. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ seemingly gave an answer for what he was truly after in the museum. And [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] confessed to having been a former inquisitor - and that he is deeply worried about the [[Order of the Iron Rose]], and his former master: [[Inquisitor Alabastia]].

After [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] had finished examining the spear ﻿Mela'uak﻿ looked intensely over at his brother, with Ohtli nodding subtly and knowingly back before moving across the room, taking the spear from [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]], and then sitting gently down in front of ﻿Mela'uak﻿.

Sitting cross-legged facing one another they each in turn scratch the spear tip across their palms, before each smearing the blood into a line in front of them, parallel to the one another. Ohtli laid the spear carefully on the ground between them, between the lines of blood. They both placed their hands, one on the blood in front of them, the other on their heart all whilst staring into each other's eyes.

The party watched on intrigued before all of a sudden both of the olmetek's backs convulsed and arched backwards. Their eyes rolled back in their heads and they both, in unison, began to mutter in the ancient language of the olmetek. Quietly at first, but slowly and surely building in intensity and volume. As the volume became loud enough to hear, the group could make out the same, repeated phrase. "Chi'ik Mak'Tar esh ixsh".

This went on for what the party guessed to be about nearly an hour. The volume became quite intense before they suddenly both stopped chanting. The hair, feathers and bones adorning both olmetek and the spear itself began to rattle and shake. It was as if there was a fierce storm blowing in the room, except no one could feel any wind on their skin or face. After another few minutes of this, the spear itself started to bead with liquid as if it were sweating. Starting from the shaft, it began to flow down towards the tip - again as if being pushed along by an unfelt wind.

As the beads of liquid moved from the dark wood of the shaft to the dirty white bone tip, it become apparent that the viscous liquid was blood that seemed to be oozing out from within the spear. The drops began to gradually coalesce and shift increasingly until the tip was dripping freely with blood. Then - an instant later - blood started rapidly flowing from Ohtli's hand, through the painted line in front of him, mixing with the pool under the tip of the spear, and then racing off toward ﻿Mela'uak﻿ and the wound in his hand, drawing mysterious right-angled shapes along its path as if running along an unseen maze. Those who were looking closely noticed a small crackle of electrical energy emanating from the tip of the spear, tracing a rune that became scorched into the bone. A final gust of wind and the rattling stopped. The olmetek's backs straightened once again, and their eyes came back into the front of their heads as the room fell silent once more. The two olmetek leant forward and firmly embraced above the spear.

"We will avenge the Tar tribe my brother and end the bloodshed of the Olmetek people"

﻿Mela'uak﻿ swiftly reached down and took the spear in his hands - one on the shaft, one covering the rune on the tip of the spear - and stood back up. He moved to place it on his back tip down as if stowing it despite possessing no harness to carry it with. However, as he rested it against the black panther skin draped across his back the spear vanished with just the faintest wisp of wind before all their eyes.

Sometime later, a knock is heard at the door - the pattern of which is lost on all but ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ and ﻿Mela'uak﻿. A man enters the room and begins silently ferrying in supplies from a cart out in the hallway. With rehearsed practice, he carries a few boxes of fresh food into the room and places them underneath the existing ones. Next, several large simple pottered jugs of fresh water. Finally, some bundles of firewood are added to the existing supply. He makes no effort to interact with you all at first, nor does he hide his face from view. What strikes you all as you watch him is that the man is so average looking, so incredibly unassuming, so unremarkable normal that you know for certain you would fail to recognise him if you saw him on the surface.

As he begins to leave through the door, ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ pointedly clears his throat. The man is startled and turns back slightly flustered.

"Apologies." he offers, "Mind was elsewhere. Not had a live room in a few weeks." his voice, much like his appearance, are totally unassuming and unrecognisable. In yet more seemed rehearsedness he quickly proclaims: "Guild district is on lockdown by the city guard. Seems someone broke into the museum last night. Took a spear, an amulet, several minor trinkets, and killed a young boy. Rumour has it the [[demon hunters]] were summoned to the scene, though no one seems to know why. Official advice from up top is to lay low and keep to the sewers. If you have to come up, keep to one district and use the network to move between them. Don't go using the bridges."
at apparently finished he turns to leave again, adding as he walks out of the room: "If you have any special requests, leave them on the parchment on the notice board. I'll come and check it this evening." At last, the quartermaster closes the door behind him, and you hear the faint squeak of cart wheels grow ever distant before you are surrounded once again by silence.

Approximately two weeks after the museum heist, ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿, and ﻿Mela'uak﻿ found themselves together in the safe room under the city. They discussed their recent endeavours and collectively agreed that: they were all tired of being couped up, they find ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ disturbing, and they were sick of smelling like a sewer.

  

After taking several underground passageways, the trio surfaced in the ﻿Artisan's District﻿ and headed straight to the public bathhouse. There they soaked in the heated baths and discussed matters some more. At one point the conversation turned to their prior experiences in the city, and ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿' revealed that he grew up in the ﻿Merchant's Quarter﻿. He suspected that his father and brother still worked there, selling fine carpets from a store in the indoor market.

  

﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ then explained that he had received word from a high-ranking member of the thieves guild (a 'boarish' individual named ﻿Dormian﻿ , who was a close personal friend if ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ was to be believed). He had been instructed to bring the items they had 'recovered' from the museum immediately. ﻿Mela'uak﻿ and ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ wished to tag along.

  
  

After a brief stop at the Fishbones, the three headed back down into the sewers, this time taking a route much deeper than they had been before. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ claimed with much bravado that he knew exactly where he was going, but ﻿Mela'uak﻿ chose to trust in the various cryptic runes - that only he seemed to understand - which were posted at several junctions.

  

Passing through a seemingly abandoned underground market, the group were suddenly ambushed by a large band of cloaked figures, who descended silently from the shadows and viciously attacked ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ with poisoned blades. He attempted to scare them away but quickly succumbed to the poison. Springing into action, ﻿Mela'uak﻿ put himself in harm's way to cover the now unconscious bortusken, slaying some of the wretched sewer dwellers. [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] was then able to destroy the remainder with precise applications of arcane magic. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ was near death, but the timely application of some first aid removed the worst of the poison, and ﻿Mela'uak﻿ sacrificed a healing potion to restore the [[Mages|bard]] to better health. For ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, this was the first time he had ever felt that someone had his back and cared about his wellbeing. To say that the experience moved him would be an understatement. ﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ inspected the bodies of the shadowy figures and guessed that they might be members of the [[Cult of the Eternal Night]] - doomsayers who believe the end of the world is approaching.

  
  

After this ordeal, the trio was able to locate a guild meeting point a short distance away in a large cistern containing around a dozen members all going about various dealings. They were called upon - by name - by ﻿Dormian﻿. He congratulated them on their work at the museum, implying that the use of demons was an inspired way to throw off any scent of guild involvement (the party chose not to correct the record). He collected the ruby necklace and brass amulet from ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, and then instructed each party member to name a reward they deemed appropriate.

  

﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ asked for gold and that he be kept in mind for future guild activity - such as the planned heist of arcoal (the fuel for skyships) that he had heard about. He received a large sack of coins and ﻿Dormian﻿ made a note in his pocketbook. ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿ was also patched up by a guild [[Mages|mage]], who fully cured him of his poison.

  

﻿Mela'uak﻿ requested that the guild provide any information on the former Captain that he was searching for - the man who ransacked his village and stole the spear from his people. Again, ﻿Dormian﻿ made a note in his book and promised to pass on information if it became available.

  

﻿[[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]﻿ inquired as to whether his help recovering the items from the museum would square the debt he owed the guild. He also asked that the guild compensate the family of the scribe who was killed during the heist and requested any information that the guild had on his former master - [[Inquisitor Alabastia]]. ﻿Dormian﻿ confirmed that his debt was paid, though made a point of telling [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] that his skills as a telepath made him valuable, and so the guild would happily work with him again in the future. He made more notes in his leather book and intimated that the Avento family would see to it that the scribe's family received a charitable donation to help with their tragic loss. He finally agreed to a similar bargain to the one he had offered ﻿Mela'uak﻿ - that any information gathered would be passed on as requested.

  

Finally, [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] warned of the nearby presence of the Cult, to which ﻿Dormian﻿ was seemingly unaware.

  
  

With all that squared away, the group headed up a nearby access point and out into the evening air of the city above. They found their way to a fancy inn called the Sage & Flagon, just opposite the central park in the ﻿Artisan's District﻿. There they finally enjoyed a round purchased by ﻿[[Thrakor]]﻿, and [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] telepathically invited ﻿Arbor﻿ to join them if he was free. He also sent his familiar Carrion, to find ﻿[[Ballthasar]]﻿ and peck him until he came to the inn to join them.
