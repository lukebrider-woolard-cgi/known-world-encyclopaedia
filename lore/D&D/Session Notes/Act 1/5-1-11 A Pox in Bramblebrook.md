*Bramblebrook, Greenhart, Norcernwere. Darkeneve - year 1 - 5th Age* 
## Abridged Session Notes
- The adventurers all meet in the local tavern in [[Bramblebrook]] and introduce themselves. They begin to gather rumours and learn about the recent pox outbreak in the village. As a whole, the group were sympathetic to the plight of the locals.
- The party first speaks to the herbalist, Brilla. [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] uses his telepathic abilities to discover that she is working with a [[Mages|witch]].
- The group goes to confront the [[Mages|witch]], but discovers that she is a friendly hermit called [[Clebekah]], who is helping the locals despite the danger to herself. She and [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] share a telepathic conversation, and the party seem understanding of her need for deception.
- The party investigates a rumour of foul smelling air and find a hanging tree with rotting corpses nearby. It does not appear to be the source of the outbreak, though they still bury the bodies.
- Next, they head north to investigate the delayed [[apothecaries]], finding them dead on the road. The party are ambushed by bandits and a fight ensues. They are victorious and take the surviving bandits, including their leader Jethro, prisoner.
- The party take the recovered healing reagents to Brilla, and show her a note they found which seemed to be a tip the bandits had received about the caravan. Brilla is shocked to recognise the handwriting of Sheriff Fenchurst. 
- The captive bandits are taken to Constable Reggie, who explains the sheriff has asked for anyone with healing abilities to help the sick. During the evening, some of the party hunt for food to feed the village, whilst others sureil the sheriff and constable. 
- The next day, Reggie takes the party to meet the sheriff, whom the party secretly want to question. The demon possessing the sheriff decides to attack first, killing Reggie and then turning on the party. [[Ephemeridae Bellflower|Ephemeridae]] is also badly wounded, but debilitating spells from the party prevent the demon from inflicting more casualties. 
- The party banish the demon and alert the guards. They are unable to reward the party properly, so the group volunteers to take the bandits and any corpses to [[Crossroads]].
