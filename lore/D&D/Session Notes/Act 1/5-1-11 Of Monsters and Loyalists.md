- The next day, the party follows a rumour of a monster attacking nearby farmsteads. They discover a recently destroyed farm, the sole survivor of which is [[Brie Faiseden|Brie]]. After hiding her safely, the party tracks down the monster. It is a bovine, the same one that recently killed [[Ephemeridae Bellflower|Ephemeridae]]'s father.

He learns that the soldiers have joined the [[Order of the Iron Rose]].
- [[Kaspar Elderclaw|Kaspar]] attempted to enter the fort whilst shapeshifted, but was caught and taken prisoner. The disguised party members fake an interrogation, until the Order's local leader, Sir Fallion, arrived.

- [[Sir Griswald]] arrives with the town garrison. They make short work of the loyalists, with only a few escaping into the woods.
