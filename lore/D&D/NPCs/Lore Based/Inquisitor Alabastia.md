Alabastia led the coup at Northwatch which triggered the civil war in the Northern Kingdom. She was [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]]' superior at the time, until he abandoned his duties and fled with the help of the [[Thieves' Guild]]. [[Erathis Ashguard|Erathis]] has made enquiries into what became of her during and after the war, but has so far not discovered much.
