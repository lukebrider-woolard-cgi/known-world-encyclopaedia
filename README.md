# Encyclopaedia Web App

## Goal:

To display Known World lore created in markdown files for Obsidian on a Github Pages web app.

## Development:

Markdown files are created in Obsidian as a part of my personal lore notes.
A Vite React-TypeScript web app is then used to display select items from this lore repository.

### Working with the code:

- Clone the repository.
- Run the command `yarn install` in the root of the directory to install node packages.
- Run the command `yarn vite` in the root of the directory to run a localhost version of the app.
- The Github Page will be run from the `live` branch.
